            "content_html": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Round Up</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><strong>Saturday</strong></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After a gruelling three months of state championship football of a questionable standard, it was all eyes on Morumbi at 4pm on Saturday for the season-opener between </span><strong>São Paulo</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and Rio’s </span><strong>Botafogo. </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At least that should have been the case, were it not for the suits’ decision to air this game on pay-per-view. Given that five of the home team’s last six games in their stadium had ended goalless draws, we can’t imagine there were too many neutrals tuning in. Those that did however, would have been relieved to see the net bulge more than once. While it was Pato’s return to Brazil that hogged all the pre-match headlines, it was goals from </span><strong>Everton</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at the end of the first half and </span><strong>Hudson</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the 83rd minute that saw the Paulista runners up start the league with three points.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><strong>Internacional</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, who have been riding high in the Libertadores, were given a reality check with a 2x0 defeat at last season’s strugglers </span><strong>Chapecoense</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. They will have to  replicate their continental form quickly if they with to be in with a shout of repeating last year’s third place finish. The home team meanwhile, having adeptly avoided the drop since the tragedy of 2016, were tipped by many to go down this season, and new boss <strong>Ney Franco</strong> will be hoping this isn’t simply a case of new-manager syndrome.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Newcomers </span><strong>Avai</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> put up a good fight away to </span><strong>Atletico Mineiro MG</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> before losing out 2x1. They cancelled out </span><strong>Fabio Santos</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’  45th minute goal immediately after the break through </span><strong>Brizuela</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> but their parity only lasted 8 minute before going down to a 53rd minute goal from <strong>Oliveira; </strong>they will now be aware of what lies ahead in their fight to stay up this season.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The day’s standout fixture between </span><strong>Flamengo</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><strong>Cruzeiro</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at the Maracana didn’t disappoint. Among 10 yellow cards and one red there were four goals. Cruzeiro took the lead a few minutes before half-time, Pedro Rocha providing the finish after some good work from the evergreen Fred. A matter of seconds later Flamengo were level, Fabio coming off his line but failing to deal with the cross as Bruno Henrique got their first, thereafter ensued an almost-comical race to grab the finishing touch as the ball drifted slowly towards the goal line; Bruno Henrique himself got his foot to the ball just before Gabigol could nod it home. Halfway through the first half Flamengo took the lead and again it was </span><strong>Bruno Henrique </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">who finished the move after Gabigol and Aaron linked up nicely in the right-hand side of the penalty area, though Cruzeiro could count themselves somewhat unlucky given the wicked deflection. Bruno Henrique continued a dominant individual performance by drawing a second yellow from Murilo Cerqueira, before stretching the defence one more time, his shot forcing Fabio to parry straight into the path of </span><strong>Gabigol</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to put the icing on the cake in this early-season battle between potential title contenders.</span></p>\n<br><br><br><br>\n<p><strong>Sunday</strong></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The day began with an impressive away win for </span><strong>Santos</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at </span><strong>Gremio</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The Peixe took a 2x0 lead by the 35th minute through goals from </span><strong>Sasha,</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a lovely dink over the keeper</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and </span><strong>Jonatan</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> after Gremio failed to properly clear a corner. The hosts were unsurprisingly upset when they had a goal disallowed by VAR via an extremely marginal offside decision. They were however able to claim a late and rather thrilling consolation goal; Manchester City target Everton Soares demonstrating a frightening turn of pace and electric finish from a tight angle. That was in stoppage-time and there was still late drama to come, though sadly not of the fotballing variety; the game ending in the all-too-familiar sight of a crowd of players arguing with the officials before Derlis Gonzalez managed to get himself sent off after the final whistle had gone - perhaps not his greatest achievement. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><strong>Atletico Paranaense</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> will find themselves amongst the teams at the top after the first weekend. Having smashed 2 past </span><strong>Vasco</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in each half; only a 90th minute effort from the Rio team  stopped Atletico being goal-difference leaders at the end of the weekend. One of the teams keeping them off first place are </span><strong>Ceara</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. They ran out 4x0 victors against </span><strong>CSA</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. It looks like it will be a long season for the newly-promoted team from Alagoas.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><strong>EC Bahia</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> laid down their intentions by beating </span><strong>Corinthians</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by the odd goal in 5 in Salvador. WIth scores tied a 1x1 at half time, Bahia rushed to a 3x1 second half lead before </span><strong>Clayson’s </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">90th minute goal made for a nervous finale.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The day’s late games saw mixed fortunes for the last two promoted sides to play this weekend. </span><strong>Goias</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> shocked </span><strong>Fluminense</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at the Maracana with </span><strong>Rafael Vaz</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> netting a last minute winner for the away side. In São Paulo </span><strong>Palmeiras</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> steamrolled <strong>Rogerio Ceni</strong>’s </span><strong>Fortaleza</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in his first managerial return to the city in which he made his legend as a player but left ignominiously when sacked from his beloved São Paulo FC in 2017.</span></p>",

            "content_html": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new season is upon us as the state championships make way for the Brasileirao. Futebol Brazil has awoken from its summer slumber ready to fill you in on the season that lies ahead.</span></p>\n<p> <strong>Big Moves</strong></p>\n<p> <strong>Gabigol</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most notable in-league transfer was that of Gabigol. Last season’s top scorer netted eighteen times in Serie A for Santos, who despite a solidly mid-table finish looked to be flirting with relegation at one stage. Consequently, expectations will be understandably high in some quarters and it will be interesting to see if the 22-year-old has developed the maturity necessary for a consistent follow-up season. The early signs are good, with the ex-Inter Milan star bagging two goals in three games in the Copa Libertadores and seven from twelve in the Carioca championship. Flamengo will be hoping his goals can push them one step further to the title in 2019.</span></p>\n<p> <strong>Pato</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another return to Brazil for the once prodigal son Alexandre Pato marked the biggest coup from outside the league. Since leaving Brazil in 2015 Pato endured an unproductive stint on loan at Chelsea before a marginally better run at Villareal (though he at least got some game time with the latter). More recently however, he filled his boots in China with thirty goals in just forty-seven games. Now in his third stint playing in his homeland, the former Selecao star will be looking to continue his impressive scoring form when he returns to Paulista championship runners up Sao Paulo.</span></p>\n<p> <strong>Dudu</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Defending champions Palmeiras can count the signing of a contract extension of last years Golden Ball winner Dudu as their best piece of non-transfer transfer business, the attacking midfielder having put pen to paper on a new four-year deal last month. The diminutive Brazilian dominated many a defence in 2018 and with his pace and incision is a sure bet to continue terrorising full-backs up and down the country in 2019. </span></p>\n<p><br><strong>Ones to Look Out For</strong></p>\n<p> <strong>Everton Soares</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">High expectations and links to top Premier League clubs accompanied Everton’s graduation from Fortaleza’s youth set-up in 2012. Last season saw the Gremio forward reach double-figures for the first time in the Brasileirao and he was rewarded with a place in Tite’s squad for Brazil’s friendlies back in August. Having turned twenty-three last month and with seven goals in all competitions so far this season, 2019 could finally be his breakout year - Manchester City are understood to have already spoken to Gremio about a transfer to England in the next few months.</span></p>\n<p> <strong>Rodrygo</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last season saw more big names make the annual migration to Europe. With Vinicius now establishing himself with Real Madrid, his soon to be teammate Rodrygo will have until June of this season to say his goodbyes to Brazil. It will be interesting to see how much game time and what sort of treatment last seasons “most promising newcomer” will receive.</span></p>\n<p> <strong>Antony</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having already proved a game winner for Sao Paulo’s sub-20 team, Antony will be looking to make the step up this season. He excelled as his team won the Copa do Brasil at youth level and will be hoping Pato’s arrival doesn’t limit his game time.</span></p>\n<p> <strong>Title Tilt</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">History dictates that we are likely to get our winners from the greater Sao Paulo or Rio area. Last season’s league went down to the penultimate game and this seasons should be just as exciting: runners-up </span><strong>Flamengo</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> having added 2018’s top-scorer in an effort to topple </span><strong>Palmeiras</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Only a brave individual would bet against the Verdao however, who having kept hold of key performers such as Dudu, Deyverson and Lucas Lima, will be confident of defending the title. As we saw in 2018, the team led by Felipao and an ageing-Felipe Melo seem to possess the required ‘know-how’ *ahem* to get the better of their rivals in tight situations.</span></p>\n<p> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the pedigree of those above, 2019’s buzz team is undoubtedly </span><strong>Cruzeiro</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The Minas giants strolled to the Mineiro title earlier this month and have utterly-dominated their (admittedly weak) Libertadores group - at the time of writing they’ve won five from five without conceding a single goal in over 450 minutes of continental football. Last year’s Copa do Brasil trophy is evidence of undoubted quality - the question now is can they maintain such a high-level of performance over thirty-eight games.</span></p>\n<p> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for the rest, early-season Libertadores form might not tell us much about how things will finish in December, but it’s certainly a more reliable indicator than the less-than-competitive state championships. Last season’s title dark horses </span><strong>Internacional</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are running away with their group, which contains no less than the holders, River Plate. Similarly, </span><strong>Atletico Paranaense</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are topping a group with last year’s other illustrious finalists Boca Jrs. Fresh from winning the Copa Sudamericana, the Curitiba side aren’t a bad outside bet for a title push that would really upset the established axes of power in Brazilian football.</span></p>\n<p> <strong>New Boys</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Up from Serie B come CSA, Goias, Avai and Serie B champion Fortaleza. It will be a baptism of fire for Fortaleza as they meet Palmeiras at the Allianz this Sunday. CSA will host the Porcos in the following game week so we should have an early indicator how these two will fare with the step up.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Love or hate the state competitions, the Brasileirao is where the modern day meat of competition lies for the colossuses of Brazilian football. With plenty of twists and turns along the way - along with a certain Copa America in July- this promises to be a great year ahead. </span></p>\n<p><br><br></p>",

            "content_html": "<p>Last month the draw for the 2019 Copa America was made to much fanfare. A slew of former pros graced the stage, providing us with the media-savvy answers you might expect - other than the Paraguay representative, who creased up at the concept of Qatar and their rich footballing history joining the party!</p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It isn’t so long since the World Cup was here, and even less time since Brazil won their first men’s Olympic gold for football on home soil. So you might well assume that, with these tournaments not more than five years in the past, we are looking forward to a faultless tournament played in some cutting-edge stadiums. You might well assume that the infrastructure is in place for a smooth festival of football. Well, you know what they say about assumption...</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Around the world, the 2014 World Cup is largely regarded as a success. However, closer to home in Brazil it is seen through a different lens (and not just because of the game in Belo Horizonte that shall not be named). The months before the tournament were mired in protest and widespread dismay at the cost of the thing in a country where the average wage is around $20 USD a day. A less than popular move to help finance the massive building work required for such an event was to hike up bus fares, thus hurting those who benefited least from hosting. As a result,  normal working people ended up financing stadia they would never see and a variety of projects that they would barely be able to afford to use. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, while football fans from all over the world congregated in Rio and beyond to watch the elite of international football battle it out, the residents were left to go about their day considerably worse off.  Fair play to England who, obviously aghast at this social injustice, decided to head home at the earliest possible point, their protest at the World’s inequalities a noble gesture. England’s philanthropy aside, while the rest of the World partied ‘samba style’, ordinary Brazilians were paying the price.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">‘But’, perhaps you are ready to say; ‘these things bring lots of money to a country and its people.’ Maybe you are ready to add,  ‘and they end up with some great stadiums in a football-mad country.’ Then you might want to conclude, ‘and at the very least they will have new train lines, buildings and services all aided by the increased tourist flow’. Alas, the assessment of those statements is: wrong; wrong-ish; and wrong.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every time a big sporting event comes to a country, we are always inundated with news reports citing the billions it will bring to the economy. While there certainly will be billions spent in that country, it might not always be spent in the right places. While I’m no economist, I can see that the building of infrastructure requires labour and thus jobs (unless we are going the Qatar route of modern slavery; way to think outside the box, Qatar!). I’m sure economists from Adam Smith through to the Brexit crew would agree that jobs are good. However, these jobs and services are primarily being paid for out of the Brazilian taxpayers’ pockets.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to financial analysts from the Saxo Group, of the $18 billion invested in the tournament, $14 billion came from the Brazilian people themselves, not the external tourist cash as we are often led to believe. As Forbes point out, the cost of putting on the tournament was 61% of the annual education budget but hey, who needs school? (Unless you want to count Neymar’s salary, or keep track of the goals his team let in during that semi - then it could be useful for Brazilian kids). </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You know things are bad, however, when FIFA decide to issue a document defending the World Cup. Rather than their usual, “Fuck you, we are in charge” attitude, they actually released a statement defending the 2014 World Cup. Broaching subjects such as the aforementioned misappropriation of funds that could have been used for education, through to their demands that Brazil build 12 new stadiums, the document reads like a schoolboy shouting “It wasn’t me!” as the teacher(if you can afford one) enters the room to a scene of destruction. When FIFA start lawyering up, the alarm bells should be ringing; there must be a MASSIVE problem.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Indeed, the problems of corruption in the country were deemed so colossal that it has managed to swing the country towards a far right President who has a yearning for the good old days of dictatorship.A president who, ironically enough, chose the Brazil home kit to front his “Brazil is my party” campaign. Obviously not all of that corruption was associated with the World Cup or football, but the Brazilian FA aren’t showing themselves to be the cleanest organisation with former head Jose Marin jailed last year for accepting bribes from TV companies for broadcasting rights to...Copa America!</span></p>\n<br><br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, now we can agree that it costs quite a lot of money to host an international football tournament and the financial benefits are, to quote the credit rating business Moody’s, “fleeting” at best, let's move on to the legacy. Events such as this are meant to increase the standard of living across a country. Transport, security and sporting facilities are all meant to improve as the country readies itself for the influx of people from around the world. Not so in Brazil 2014. Of the 12 host cities, only Rio finished all their construction projects; and I mean by now Now, in 2019, only Rio have finished!</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maybe not the transport then, but the stadiums. Well yes, the stadiums were all finished for kick off and resplendent throughout - bar Arena Corinthians, which had a temporary stand installed at one end. However, within a year of the event, the third most expensive stadium in the world, the $900 million Estadio Nacional in Brasilia, was being used as a car park. Corinthians finally finished their stadium, but still can’t get out from under the debt caused by having to rent their home from the state, and the Arena da Amazonia is living up to its name having been reclaimed by the world’s largest rainforest. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of all the stadia used, 10 were new, such as the 42,000 seater Arena da Baixada. New home of Atletico Paranese, it had about 13,000 fans the day I went to watch them. With a retractable roof and all the mod-cons of a premium stadium, it cast an eerie atmosphere, even when the home team were on a run of 5 victories in a row and winning 3-0 on the day. Even taking into account that four out of the six venues being used for the Copa America 2019 were built for the World Cup, that is still 33% of the tournament being played in stadiums that were already standing pre-2014.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite all this, six months away from the tournament, here at Futebol Brazil we’re giddily waiting for the tournament to begin.If things go their way, Brazil will have the chance of redemption in Belo Horizonte-in a semi-final no less. Messi will have one last crack at a Copa, having lost the last two finals, and Neymar should be fully rested from his annual get-injured-or-suspended-so-I-can-go-to-my-sister’s-birthday-party. Even good old Qatar have shown themselves a more serious on-field proposition, beating Japan 3-1 in the final of the Asian equivalent of the Copa last month. All in all,  the tournament will, no doubt, be seen as a success, but let’s not pretend it didn’t come at a big cost. </span></p>",

            "content_html": "<p>Every year, usually in the first few months when the state championships begin, the debate returns: should these championships be axed?</p>\n<p>​In a country as vast as Brasil, this issue is complex because of the major internal differences. The national championship, the Campeonato Brasileiro, is only disputed between the teams of the principal states, whilst the press, who exert such a great influence over the preferences of the average Brazilian fan, are all located in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. As a result, the concept of regionalised, state championships is one that faces increasing pressure with every passing year.</p>\n<p>​In view of these considerations, we return to the beginning of football in the country, which occurred through the state championships. After all, geographically, a Brazilian state is usually the equivalent size of a European country.</p>\n<p>The first official competition, the Campeonato Paulista (Sao Paulo state championship) began in 1902. Other states soon followed suit, with the Baiano (Bahia) and Carioca (Rio de Janeiro) championships beginning in 1905 and 1906 respectively. Some European countries, such as England and Scotland, had already begun their national leagues some years before, but many, such as the Italian (1898) and German (1903) competitions, are practically the same age as the first of the Brazilian state championships.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div>With the championships, rivalries were born; many of the major rivalries of modern Brazilian football have their roots in the early 20th Century state competitions -   Grêmio and Internacional in Rio Grande do Sul, Bahia and Vitória in the state of Bahia and Corinthians and Palmeiras in São Paulo, just as examples, are only great clubs and historical rivals because of the regional tournaments. Due to structural and logistical issues, a Brazilian Championship was unthinkable at the beginning of the twentieth century. Additionally, the beginning of Brazilian football was especially localised: proudly rooted in the communities that formed the first clubs and associations.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>There were attempts to form wider competitions, particularly between Rio and Sao Paulo, and there was also the the Taca Brasil, the legacy of which can be seen in the formula of today's important Copa do Brasil. Nevertheless, it was only in 1971 that a lengthy and all-encompassing tournament, including clubs from all regions of Brazil, came into existence.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>In addition, therefore, to being more similar to the European nationals, the state chamionships hold, through their formation and geography, an essential part of the history of Brazilian football. It was in the Carioca that Flamengo became great, it was in the Paulista that Santos paraded the legendary team with Pelé and company in the 60s, and in every other state local clubs established themselves as the favourites of their people. Finally, the smaller and middle-sized clubs, who are now suffocated in shorter tournaments with little visibility or recognition, featured great stars, such as Socrates at Botafogo de Ribeirão Preto or Roberto Carlos at União São João, in many cases in times where the Brazilian national team shone much more than they do today.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>The project of the authorities is clear: to marginalise the state championships in favour of a national competition that concentrates on the big cities (especially in the capitals of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro), the richest clubs in the country, and sets aside much of the national territory for a 'quality football.' Thus, it should come as no surprise that many boys from the interior who have no relationship with the clubs of the capitals, and watch the gradual failure and sad decline of the local teams, choose to cheer for European clubs that ultimately bring together the great Brazilian stars.</div>\n<div> </div>\nKilling the state championships, an idea that advances with great support from the media, and creates a real chasm between the teams through payments for TV rights, is to destroy more than a little of what has made football the beloved sport of Brazilians.",

            "content_html": "<p>Santos</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Situated an hour to the East of Sao Paulo, the coastal city of Santos isn’t exactly picture postcard stuff. A city forged on a working class port, it is the industrial mouth of the financial metropolis that is the state capital. Santos does have a certain claim when it comes to beauty though. What it lacks in natural finesse it more than makes up for in the footballing variety. Home of Pele and Neymar, this city can claim the World’s best (in Brazilian eyes at least) and most expensive players respectively. With the latest academy prodigy, Rodrygo, on his way for $50 million to Real Madrid it seems that the boys from the beach are more than a match for their big city Paulista rivals: Corinthians; Palmeiras; and Sao Paulo. I met up with Xande, a life long fan, to find out why he chose to support the ”Peixe”.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Having written recently about how I started supporting Palmeiras I was keen to find out if there was any intrigue behind Xande’s decision to support Santos. The story I hear is one that has played out in families around the world since the game began “My father and grandfather supported them. They didn’t force me into it but they were delighted when I started being fascinated with Santos aged 5.”</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Although not an unusual story it <em>is</em> relatively unusual to be brought up within the Sao Paulo city limits and not go for one of the” big three”. Xande explains that you have a bit of a mixed identity when you choose to be a Santastico      “ Some see us as a the laid back beach team but we are also very much a Sao Paulo team. We have a big rivalry with Sao Paulo, Palmeiras and Corinthians”. This is borne out in Santos’ choice of home. In theory they play their home games at the 16,000 seater Estadio Urbano Caldeira in Santos. However, with so many of their fans living and working in Sao Paulo they often opt to play in the much larger Pacaembu just off Paulista Avenue in Central Sao Paulo.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Santos have had some highs and lows over the years and we start chatting about Xande’s life as a fan. He vents his frustration at the media’s perception of them as a little team and their disrespectful attitude. Another disappointment he feels lies not with the club but their treatment in last year’s Copa Libertadores. COMEBOL decided to award Independiente of Argentina a 3-0 win for the first leg due to the fielding of an illegible player. “ There were no Brazilian’s on the committee that made that decision and their own website said the player could play” he laments. The timing of the decision was disastrous too; just before kickoff of a second leg which should have been poised for a thriller. “This happened an hour before kickoff of the second leg. The atmosphere was bad and as the game went on the ultras started setting off “bombs”. As each one of these went off the crowd got more agitated until they started fighting and the game was abandoned “. Did he fear for his safety? “No, not really. The riot was at the other end of the stadium. On the way out the police were firing water cannons at fans but we were far enough away - so much so that people were using the spray to cool down and dance in the street!”.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>We turn to happier moments. When asked about his favourite game there isn’t a moment’s hesitation “1995 Brasileirao. It was my first time at the stadium. At that time the championship was decided by a play-off. In the first leg of the semi-final we lost 4-1 away at Fluminense. With the game “lost” there were tickets available for the return leg. Me and a few friends decided to go along and never regretted it. We won 5-2 and ended up going through. Although we lost the final to Botafogo the semi-final game was amazing. “</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>The hero of that 5-2 victory was Giovanni, latterly of Barcelona and Olympiakos fame. “ He was the main reason we won that day. We still call him the Messiah at Santos”. A recent young Santos player making his way to Europe is Rodrygo. “ He’s too young to star at the moment but hopefully he can get time to learn. Neymar left as a more complete article having just won the Copa Libertadores. He was in a great team too. Unfortunately back then we had to wait half a year between winning the Libertadores and the Club World Cup. Most of our stars had left for Europe and we ended up getting embarrassed by Barcelona 5-0” . And what of Neymar, does he have a claim to the thrown of the great Pele? “Hahaha, no way! No one comes near. Argentinian’s might say Maradona but no way. Pele was the best of the best team”.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>",

            "content_html": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now we turn to matters at the wrong end of the table. In some ways, the battle to beat the drop was more exciting than the title race, once it became clear that the green machine was going to sweep all before it, leaving little excitement for those not of a palmeirense persuasion. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rebaixamento </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to Serie B means a drop in revenue, waning attendance figures and, worst of all, the loss of face. There are four teams that have never been relegated from the top flight, and they certainly don’t let opposing fans forget it. Cruzeiro, Flamengo, Santos and Sao Paulo are the four that have been ever present since entering Serie A. It’s worth noting, however, that relegation doesn’t seem to have as damaging an effect on teams as it does when sides slip out of the Premier League. As mentioned in Part One, Internacional bounced back at the first time of asking, managing a third-place finish this year, and it was only in 2013 that this year’s champions were languishing in </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a segunda divisao</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.   </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></i></p>\n<br>\n<p><strong>11th - Bahia</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unlike the notoriously thick and humid air of their home state, Bahia blew hot and cold this season but will almost certainly feel that are more positives than negatives to take back to the north-east with them. A poor start to the season was followed by a two month unbeaten spell, which abruptly nose-dived into a run of 2 wins in 10 matches. Though they struggled to stand up to the teams at the top of the table, they showed themselves to be capable of getting important wins from the sides around them and they’ll take heart from the improvement in performances towards the end of the season. </span></p>\n<p><strong>Grade: C</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Player of the Season: Gregore</strong></p>\n<br>\n<p><strong>12th - Fluminese</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With their stadium-sharing rivals, Flamengo, flying high at the top of the league, it was important that </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">O Fluzao</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at least got the Rio derbies right. With six opportunities to restore a measure of local pride (vs. Botafogo and Vasco da Gama, as well as Flamengo), they managed just one win and one draw, which is just about right given the underwhelming performances from a team that really should be doing better. With just 32 goals all season, the third lowest in the league, this was a season to forget for everyone involved with a team that were national champions not so long ago in 2012. </span></p>\n<p><strong>Grade: D-</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Player of the Season: Pedro</strong></p>\n<br>\n<p><strong>13th - Corinthians</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With two titles in three years, expectations are never less than sky-high around the Itaquerao, and as such a title defence this limp is sure to hurt. Just two away wins all season, allied with four losses at their usually fortress-like home ground, made for a thoroughly miserable 2018 for the self-styled </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Timao</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Poor performances on the pitch were not helped by matters off it, as the board conducted their own little managerial merry-go-round. Fabio Carille’s early season departure for Al-Wehda led to the appointment of Omar Loss, who was replaced by Jair Ventura following a run of poor form, who was then sacked at the end of the season for failing to arrest the decline. Fabio Carille has been re-appointed manager for the upcoming season, and fans will be hoping for a return to form under the title-winning boss.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Grade: E</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Player of the Season: Cassio</strong></p>\n<br>\n<p><strong>14th - Chapecoense</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2018 was always likely to be a difficult season for the Santa Catarina based side. After the outpouring of support from across the globe, multiple player loans and a cathartic effort to keep the club moving forward in the aftermath of the horrific airline disaster at the tail end of the 2016 season culminated in an astonishing eighth-place finish in 2017, the season after the one before was at risk of some sizeable aftershocks. As expected, it proved a challenge, but one which </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chape</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> rose to admirably. Reasonably strong home form saw them able to balance out a very leaky defence and finish two points clear of relegation. A final day home win secured their Serie A status for another season, and there will have been few, even amongst the Sao Paulo fans gathered in the away end, that begrudged them that.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Grade: C+</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Player of the Season: Wellington Paulista</strong></p>\n<br>\n<p><strong>15th - Ceara</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Back amongst the big boys for the first time since 2011, Ceara were widely tipped to make a quick return to the second tier. Without a win after 12 rounds, it looked like the doom-mongers were right, and the ‘Big Grandpa’ (</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vozao</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">) of the northeast would roll over and accept their fate as local rivals Sport Recife rolled up to collect their 3 points. The match proved to be a turning point and sparked Ceara’s season into life. This vital win saw their home in Fortaleza become a ground that no one wanted to visit, with six wins and five draws in their remaining twelve home games enough to keep them up with a couple of points to spare.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Grade: C-</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Player of the Season: Everson</strong></p>\n<br>\n<p><strong>16th - Vasco da Gama</strong></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">O Gigante da Colina</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, one of the most storied and popular teams in all Brazil, have become that most confusing of things, for fans at least, the yo-yo club. Relegated in 2013, they came straight back up again, only to be promptly relegated on their return. Once again they lifted themselves from the canvas, Tyson Fury style, to regain a place at the top table at the first time of asking. An emotional rollercoaster for supporters, which some will see as more enjoyable than season after season of mid-table obscurity. Last season saw them buck the trend and enjoy an excellent campaign, finishing 7th with continental competition their reward. Perhaps it was too much to expect for Vasco to build on that platform, but by all measures this was another poor season and they were fortunate that the final round of fixtures fell in their favour. Nobody was surprised when they earned a goalless draw away at fellow strugglers Ceara - a result which confirmed the survival of both sides.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Grade: D</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Player of the Season: Maxi Lopez</strong></p>\n<br>\n<p><strong>17th - Sport Recife</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So to the clubs that fell through the trapdoor and into Serie B. Sport had a close shave in 2017, finishing 15th, and after a bright start which brought 5 wins in their first 10 matches, they faded badly. Despite, or perhaps due to, going through an astonishing four manager over the course of the season, Sport couldn’t find the reserves needed to close a gap that opened after taking only 6 points from a possible 51 between June and the end of September. A run of three straight wins at the end of October renewed hope of an unlikely escape, but despite beating Santos on the last day of the season, results elsewhere conspired to send them down.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Grade: D-</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Player of the Season: Jair</strong></p>\n<br>\n<p><strong>18th - America-MG</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After winning the 2017 Serie B title, finishing two points ahead of the far more established and well resourced Internacional, hopes were high in the green and black third of Belo Horizonte that they could start to address the gap between themselves and their city rivals Cruzeiro and Atletico-MG. An opening day trouncing of Sport Recife proved to be a false dawn however, and a couple more wins in their next 5 matches was as good as it got. Hope persisted until an eleven match winless run beginning in September, and by the time a three point haul finally arrived again, at home against Santos in Round 35, the damage was done.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Grade: D-</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Player of the Season: Matheusinho</strong></p>\n<br>\n<p><strong>19th - Vitoria</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vitoria were last season’s nearly men: nearly relegated and saved by the virtue of a +1 goal difference over Coritiba. That year they scored 50 goals and at least served up some entertainment for their fans. The same can’t be said for this year’s side who scored less than a goal a game on average, and conceded 63 times - by far the highest in the league this year. Unsurprisingly, they were on the wrong end of some of the biggest defeats of the season and finished six points from safety. They will hope to return to the top table at the first attempt, if only to resume their bitter rivalry with Bahia. </span></p>\n<p><strong>Grade: E</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Player of the Season: Leo Gomes</strong></p>\n<br>\n<p><strong>20th - Parana</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It might seem a little harsh to award an F to a team that was last in the top division in 2007, and who were only formed in 1989, but the fact is that the class of 2018 were dreadful for the vast majority of the campaign, and were relegated with six games left to play. With just four wins all season, and a pitiful 18 goals scored, it’s probably for the best that they have some time out of the spotlight to regroup and try to come back strong enough to average more than half a goal a game. Positives to take away? They had a better defensive record than Vitoria. They did the double over America-MG. What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger?</span></p>\n<p><strong>Grade: F</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Player of the Season: Richard</strong></p>",

            "content_html": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the dust settled on the 62nd edition of the Campeonato Brasileirao, and the last pieces of green ticker tape cleared from the streets around Allianz Parque, it’s time to look back and assess the performance of the twenty teams who contested the most-watched and richest national league outside of Europe. As with all modern football championships, there is an imbalance between the haves and have-nots, so while the the league table will certainly tell you who won the league, who will be contesting next year’s Libertadores and who will be checking Wikipedia to find out where the hell Operario Ferroviario Esporte Clube ply their trade (Ponta Grossa in Parana, in case you’re wondering), it doesn’t show you which teams achieved more than was expected of a ragtag bunch of journeymen and green-horned hopefuls, and which teams once again caused their fans to question why their side has less stamina for the race than an arthritic Shetland pony. Here’s our take on the teams who finished in the top half of the table.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><strong>1st - Palmeiras</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It took until Round 37 for </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">O Verdao </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to confirm their record-extending tenth Brasileirao title, although from September on it looked unlikely that anyone would be able to stop Big Phil’s boys in green from claiming the crown. With a home record that reads P19 W16 D2 L1, including 13 straight wins between July and the end of the season and 22 games without suffering defeat, it’s not hard to see why last season’s runners up were worthy champions this time round. A wily old coach, a mean defence and the ability to get goals from all over the pitch (only striker Willian reached double figures) made this a very enjoyable season for <em>O</em></span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">s Porcos.</span></i></p>\n<p><strong>Grade: A+</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Player of the Season: Dudu</strong></p>\n<br>\n<p><strong>2nd - Flamengo</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Credit is due to Brazil’s most widely supported team for pushing Palmeiras all the way, but even the most dedicated fan of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">O Mengao </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">must have sensed that it was not going to be their year long before Deyverson’s goal away at Vasco confirmed it. It seemed that for every misstep that Palmeiras took, Flamengo were right there behind them managing to find a banana skin all of their own. Still, this was a much better season than 2017 and credit must got to a squad that comfortably finished second despite having three managers in the calendar year. They will be hoping to go one better next year and end what will then be a ten-year wait for another title.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Grade: A- </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Player of the Season: Cuellar</strong></p>\n<br>\n<p><strong>3rd - Internacional</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The season’s surprise package came in the form of last season’s Serie B runners up, although given Internacional’s pedigree it’s perhaps not a shock to see the side back where many fans believe they belong. Relegated for the first time in their history in 2016, they bounced straight back and, after a poor start in which they won only one of their opening five fixtures, continued bouncing up the table to become unlikely title contenders. In truth, it never looked like it was going to be the fairytale </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">O Nacao Vermelha </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">were dreaming of, and in the end they finished well behind the champions. Nevertheless, they will continue to enjoy their rehabilitation under coach Odair Hellmann as they enter next season’s Libertadores.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Grade: A</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Player of the Season: Victor Cuesta</strong></p>\n<p><strong>4th - Gremio</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With their attention so focussed on the ultimately unsuccessful attempt to retain their Libertadores title, it’s not hard to imagine that had Gremio’s priorities lay in matters on the domestic front they might be basking in the glory of a first league title since 1996. A home record to rival Palmeiras was let down by flaky away form, but the team from Porto Alegre have enough about them to trouble any of the teams in the league.     </span></p>\n<p><strong>Grade: B</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Player of the Season: Everton</strong></p>\n<br>\n<p><strong>5th - Sao Paulo</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And so to the arthritic Shetland pony of the introduction to this piece. First 19 games - W12 D5 L2; last 19 games - W4 D10 L5. ‘A game of two halves’ would be a kind way of describing a season which imploded when the team and their now departed journeyman manager, Diego Aguirre, got a serious case of vertigo when leading the league at the halfway point. Aguirre - manager of 14 teams in 16 years - left the team at the beginning of November but incoming head coach Andre Jardim could only steady the ship. Positives to be taken after a 13th place finish in 2017 for sure, but more heartache for fans who wonder when the glory days will return.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Grade: C-</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Player of the Season: Diego Souza</strong></p>\n<br>\n<p><strong>6th - Atletico-MG</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Always an entertaining side to watch, Atletico-MG were involved in two of the most exciting games of the season - beating both Fluminese and Sport Recife 5-2 at the Estádio Raimundo Sampaio in Minas Gerais. A leaky defence featuring a 39-year old Leonardo Silva did them no favours, despite the heroics of goalkeeper Victor, and they will perhaps feel that an automatic Libertadores spot should have been theirs for the taking.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Grade: B-</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Player of the Season: Ricardo Oliveira</strong></p>\n<br>\n<p><strong>7th - Atletico-PR</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another side who were able to improve their 2016 standing, and another that did so in some style. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">O Furacao </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">lived up to their nickname by delivering four of the biggest home wins of the season (5x1 vs. Chapecoense; 4x0 vs. Vitoria, America-MG and Sport Recife). The second half of the season saw 11 wins and went a long way to addressing a poor start. They even found time to lift their first Copa Sudamericana. Fans who delighted in their team’s attacking prowess this season, will no doubt be looking forward to climbing new heights in 2019.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Grade: A</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Player of the Season: Pablo</strong></p>\n<br>\n<p><strong>8th - Cruzeiro</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Back-to-back titles in 2013 and 2014 mean that expectations always run high in pre-season that Cruzeiro may mount another tilt at the title. A mid-season slump and a serious lack of firepower - they scored fewer goals than relegated Vitoria and Sport Recife - meant that this attempt never got off the ground, and they have a tight defence to thank for a Sudamericana spot they barely did enough to deserve.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Grade: C-</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Player of the Season: Dede</strong></p>\n<br>\n<p><strong>9th - Botafogo</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since re-entering the top flight in 2016, Botafogo seem to have allayed fears that their 2014 relegation would lead to the historic side yo-yoing between leagues. Just three wins on the road all season however suggest that manager Ze Ricardo has a job on his hands to address one of the most porous defences outside of the relegated sides, and a team that lacks the self-belief to stand up to the ghosts of their illustrious past.    </span></p>\n<p><strong>Grade: C</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Player of the Season: Igor Rabello</strong></p>\n<br>\n<p><strong>10th - Santos</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Where would Santos be without returning hero Gabriel Barbosa? Fans of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">O Peixe </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">will be thankful that it’s a question that they don’t have to answer, because even with the league’s top scorer they never looked like breaking into the Libertadores positions, never mind the elite G4. The sacking of Paulistao winning coach Dorival Junior in 2017 looks like a significant error as they cast around for an appropriate replacement. They will be hoping that Cuca, their third manager in 18 months, is that man. </span></p>\n<p><strong>Grade: C-</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Player of the Season: Gabriel Barbosa</strong></p>",

            "content_html": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With matters at the top of the table more-or-less resolved at the end of Round 37, the top three already set in stone come what may on the last day, attention turned to the scrabble to avoid the trapdoor to Serie B. With Vitoria and Parana already making plans for life outside the top flight, there were still six sides who went into the last round of games unsure of their status next season, all fighting to avoid being one of the other two </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">rebaixados.</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps the most high stakes encounter of the round was played out at the Maracana, as two sides still in the relegation mix faced off. Fluminese, the most storied of the at risk sides, made sure that the grand old stadium won’t suffer the somewhat dubious delights of second division football with a nervy 1-0 win over America-MG. Thing started well for the away side, and in the 27th minute they were rewarded for their hard work with a penalty after left-back Marlon brought down Aderlan. Luan, with just one goal to his name this season, stepped up to take it but found Julio Cesar equal to his attempt. The goal that secured Fluminese’s status, and ultimately condemned America-MG to return to the league they won last season, came fourteen minutes later courtesy of an excellent corner delivered by Marlon, more than making up for his earlier rash challenge. Richard made no mistake as he met the ball just outside the six-yard box, powering his header past Joao Ricardo. Ceara and Vasco da Gama were also both candidates for the drop and final day opponents, but with both sides knowing that a point would more than likely be enough it was little surprise that their tie ended 0-0. There was little to cheer for either set of fans, the sides mustering up just four shots on target between them, but everyone went home happy once events elsewhere confirmed that they will meet again next year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chapecoense and Sport Recife rounded out the group of six, with the former holding their fate in their own hands and the latter relying on the results of others to give them a chance of escape. Chapecoense faced a Sao Paulo side that have looked increasingly desperate for the season to end over the last few weeks, lest they fall any further from the lofty heights they commanded for so much of the season. They still had something to play for themselves, with the chance to move into fourth spot and automatic qualification for the Libertadores on the table, although the more conspiracy-minded fans of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">O Tricolor</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> would have looked at the fixture list and suspected that Corinthians were unlikely to do them any favours in the attempt to better Gremio’s result when they played the fourth-placed side down in Rio Grande do Sul. As it was, the outcome of that match hardly mattered as Sao Paulo slumped to a 1-0 defeat and a season that promised so much became yet another one to forget. In the 68th minute, Leandro Pereira headed in the winning goal from a looped ball into the box, sparking scenes of delight in the crowd. This was followed by a nervous 25 minutes until the team that had just four days earlier commemorated the second anniversary of the tragic air disaster that robbed them of the most successful squad in their history could confirm their place in next season’s top division. Sport Recife faced Santos at home knowing that nothing short of a win would do. To their credit, they fulfilled their part of the requirement, beating their guests 2-1 following goals from Rogerio and Hernane, with Rodrygo pulling one back for Santos, however with the results in the round’s other ties not going their way all of their hard work counted for naught and they ultimately finished a point, and a more than a few hatfuls of goals, behind sixteenth-placed Vasco.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Allianz Parque, the title celebrations were in full swing before kick-off and events on the pitch were of secondary importance to the trophy presentation after the match. As it was, the champions did what they have done all season and won at home, their only home loss of the season coming way back in May against Sport Recife, beating Vitoria 3-2. After taking a two goal lead, the hosts were pegged back by two goals in quick succession before Bruno Henrique put the icing on the championship-winning cake with a sweet strike from outside the area in the 90th minute. Those Sao Paulo fans who suspected that Corinthians wouldn’t exactly exert themselves in their match against Gremio will feel their suspicions were well placed as Jael headed in from close range after 12 minutes as Cassio flapped at a deflected shot. Corinthians supporters will surely point to their team’s poor form this season and the fact that they were playing a superior side as the reasons their side only managed one shot on and one shot off target in 90 minutes, although this is unlikely to change the minds of their aggrieved rival fans.      </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elsewhere, Parana managed to exit the stage with a semblance of pride, despite ending the season with just 23 points. A 1-1 draw with third-placed Internacional suggests that it might not be too long until the team from Curitiba make a return to the top flight. Two teams with nothing to play for and at least one eye on the beach before the state championships begin met in Salvador as Bahia played host to Cruzeiro. A game to forget ended 0-0 with the home side not even able to muster up the enthusiasm to get a shot on target. For reasons that aren’t quite clear, the last round of games did not all take place on Sunday. On Saturday night, Atletico-PR took a very creditable three point off Flamengo as they beat this year’s runners up 1-2 on their home turf. After falling behind to a 23rd minute Rholdolfo goal, second half strikes from Mateus Rossetto and Rony meant that the club from Parana end the season unbeaten in eight games. A degree of shine was taken off the achievement as Willian Arao of Flamengo and goal scorer Rony were both sent off late on. A poor challenge on the Atletico-PR forward earned Arao his second yellow before Rony reacted impetuously to provocation from Fernando Uribe by throwing out his shoulder at the striker. Also on Saturday night, Juan Cazares 18th minute goal meant that Atletico-MG beat Botafogo 1-0 and finished in sixth place, earning themselves a Libertadores playoff spot in the process.  </span></p>",

            "content_html": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Palmeiras were crowned champions of the Brasileirao in a double game week where they claimed their 21st and 22nd victories of the season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The only thing to take a degree of shine off this moment for the team in green and white was the fact that their title win was confirmed in the environs of the Estadio Club de Regatas, rather than in front of their own fans, although many made the journey up to Rio in the hope of seeing their side confirm themselves as this year’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">campeoes. </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They were made to wait for their moment until the weekend despite sweeping aside America-MG 4-0 on Wednesday evening, as Flamengo gamely continued their ultimately fruitless attempt to haul in the leaders by beating Gremio 2-0. Sao Paulo had a golden opportunity on Thursday evening to leapfrog Gremio into fourth spot only to blow it by losing 2-0 away to Vasco da Gama. Internacional had also lost 1-2 at home to Atletico-MG the night before, so the status quo at the top was maintained for another round. Elsewhere on Wednesday, Santos and Botafogo drew 1-1, while Corinthians slipped to defeat 15 of the season, losing 1-0 away at Atletico-PR. On Thursday evening, Chapecoense earned vital points as they beat Sport Recife 2-1. Bahia took full points from Fluminese, winning 2-0, while Ceara eeked past Parana 1-0.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The penultimate round of the season kicked off in some style on Saturday evening as Santos hosted Atletico-MG. Uruguayan midfielder Carlos Santos got Santos off to a very quick start, scoring a fantastic free-kick after just 97 seconds. Not to be deterred, Atletico-MG struck back with a long range effort of their own, Ricardo Oliveria driving a low shot in off the post in the 17th minute. Seventeen minutes later and Santos were back in front: Felippe Cardoso finishing from close range after a give-and-go. Gabriel then got his 18th goal of the season in similar circumstances to put his team 3-1 ahead at the interval. Seven minutes after the break, the Santos defence had a moment to forget as goalkeeper Vanderlei managed to misjudge the flight of a corner allowing Ricardo Oliveira to grab his second of the game. Atletico-MG continued to press but to no avail, and Santos were able to hang on for maximum points despite having goal-scorer Carlos Santos dismissed in the 77th minute. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the pre-show entertainment over, all eyes turned to Sunday’s fixtures, and in particular Palmeiras’ visit to Vasco da Gama. Vasco, buoyed by their midweek win over Sao Paulo, were in no mood to make it easy for </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Os Porcos</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and frustrated the visitors until midway through the second half. When it came, the goal that won the league was delivered from very close range. A long ball over the top of the Vasco defence was touched into the path of Deyverson who had the easiest of tasks to stroke home his ninth and most important goal of the season. With this win, it didn’t matter what happened in Flamengo’s game away at Cruzeiro, but the they secured second place with a 0-2 win - both goals coming from Everton Ribeiro and both worthy of winning a title rather than finishing runner up. The first was a smart finish from an acute angle after beating a couple of static Cruzeiro players; the second a wonderful strike from outside the area. The other two 5pm ties ended in draws: Vitoria and Gremio played out a 0-0, which meant that Sao Paulo were given another chance to go into the last round of games in fourth place if they could beat Sport Recife on Monday evening. The result was even less desirable for Vitoria as it confirmed that they will be joining Parana in Serie B next season. Atletico-PR and Ceara put on a much better show for the crowd as their match ended 2-2. Ceara went into half-time a goal to the good after Leandro Carvalho met a long ball over the top with a volley across Felipe Alves and into the bottom corner of the Atletico-PR net. The second half saw the home side draw level and then take the lead in the 58th minute - goals coming from Marcinho and Lucho Gonzalez - only for Ceara to restore parity when Wescley pick up on a poor clearance from Jose Ivaldo to slot the ball past Everson.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 7pm kick offs saw America-MG claim an absolutely vital win, one which ensured that their destiny will not be decided until the last day. Juninho’s 47th minute scuffed effort won’t win any goal of the season awards, but it might be the most important of the season for his team. Bahia then had centre-back Tiago Pagnussant sent off for a second bookable offence with three minutes left of regular time. Internacional cemented their third place finish as they beat Fluminese 2-0. Nicolas Lopez got both goals: the first, in the 75th minute, was a brilliant volley into the top corner from the edge of the Fluminese area following a headed clearance; the second, fourteen minutes later, was a much more routine affair as he reached Andres D’Alessandro’s through ball and finished calmly, placing the ball under the out-rushing Rodolfo. Corinthians’ dreadful season managed to muster up the strength to keep Chapecoense at bay for 90 minutes, although any meaningful attempts to score were few and far between and resulted in just one shot on goal for the home side. The point was enough to ensure that the reigning champions won’t suffer the ignominy of competing in the second division next season, but time must surely be running out for </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">treinador </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jair Ventura. Chapecoense, meanwhile, have given themselves every chance of staying up when they host Sao Paulo next weekend.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Monday evening saw Round 37 complete as Botafogo hosted Parana and Sao Paulo took on Sport Recife at the Morumbi stadium. There was little to play for but professional honour in Rio as Botafogo sat firmly in mid-table while Parana’s relegation was confirmed at the end of Round 32. In the end, they served up more entertainment that expected with two goals for Botafogo's Erik sandwiching a strike from Parana's Alex Santana. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sao Paulo still had fourth place and an automatic Libertadores spot firmly in their sights, and knew that a win against 18th placed Sport Recife would go a long way towards achieving that aim. Sport themselves had even more to play for as a win would take them up a place and level with Chapecoense in their battle to stay in the division. Neither side, therefore, will have been pleased with the point they took away from their stalemate. Sao Paulo now need to better Gremio's final day result, while Sport must hope for a win at home to Santos and for results elsewhere to go their way in order to maintain their position in the top flight. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">    </span></p>",

            "content_html": "<p>When I found out that I was moving to Sao Paulo the first thing I knew I had to research was the football teams at my disposal and pick one to start going to. A Celtic season ticket holder until I began travelling the world, I had gone eight years without really having a local team to call my own. In China I had been to a few Shanghai Shenhua games and had the chance to watch Nicholas Anelka play defensive midfield, something not many people have had the comic fortune to witness. In Slovakia I chose to play rather than attend games, so before coming to Brazil I was going to right a wrong and start following a team for real again. Sao Paulo is a city rich in football history and success so surely I was going to find a team to follow. In those years away from regular attendance something had certainly been missing. Yes, there is something fun about meeting up with a bunch of Glaswegians in a dingy Shanghai pub in the wee hours of the morning to watch a dodgy stream but something was always lacking. The sights and sounds of game day are things that make the game all the more enjoyable. The way to the stadium, the meeting of friends, the habitual pint in the same old pub (a war zone on an off day and a paradise of stale beer and pregame analysis on those halcyon afternoons). These were the things I’d been missing and was looking to find. But where?</p>\n<p> Within a one-hour circumference of the city (make that 1-12 hours depending on the crazy traffic here) you can see four of the nation’s big teams: by the seaside, outside the city, you have home of Pele; Santos. As well as the Brazilian legend they can count Neymar and Rodrygo amongst their recent alumni and won the Libertadores in 2011. In the North of the city there is Palmeiras the most successful team in terms of Brasileirao championships; West is Sao Paulo FC who gave Kaka a start in the game and play their games in the 72,000 capacity Estadio Morumbi where the opening ceremony of the Copa America 2019 will be held; and to the East, Corinthians, the “team of the people” that conquered Chelsea in the 2012 FIFA World Club Cup competition. But who to support?</p>\n<p> Picking a team isn’t something you really do as an adult. Most football fans will have had their team since a young age. Maybe family influenced, maybe the team of the day, maybe a moral or a style choice. Whatever the reason you will have chosen young and then stuck with it. For this reason I’ve seen some ups and some downs following Celtic through the 80s, 90s and beyond. The pleasure of those years was the emotional attachment; the sense of belonging. Going to a local “non-dom” primary school could be agonizing as Rangers waltzed to 9-in-a-row however the joy of winning the league in ’98 was magnified through the prism of that pain. Now, as a fully-grown adult, I was about to choose a team to cheer on in a language that I barely understood. Was it possible to find a team to share the same connection with?</p>\n<p>A bit of research was in order and so I set about picking my Brazilian team. A simple scan of Google images got me on the right path. For someone with a deep-rooted love of my home club it may seem a bit facile to choose a team to support based on the colour of their strip but with only 20kg of luggage to haul with me it was handy when you could mix and match your kits! So, Palmeiras it was. Looking beyond the superficial, the decision actually made more sense. Both clubs founded by immigrants to represent a minority of society (Irish in Scotland and Italian in Brazil). Both clubs with passionate and vocal fans. Both are clubs with a history of playing attacking and exciting football. I’d found a new football home. But surely my passion couldn’t be the same as for the club I supported as a boy?</p>\n<p> Well, three seasons down the line I can count myself as being on the way to being a Porco (the club nickname- a denigration of the Italian community embraced as a badge of honour by the fans). Of course it’s a work in progress. Slowly but surely I’m building up a friend group of fellow fans. Slowly learning the songs and feeling less like an outsider. Gradually feeling like I belong in this new family. And the Palmereise have helped this process of assimilation. If I ever turn up to a game in the hoops then invariably I will be stopped and asked about Celtic and why I’m here by people keen to share their love of Palmeiras. Nothing quite matches your first team but I feel I’ve made a good choice for my life in Brazil. Then again everything looks good through green and white tinted spectacles!</p>",
