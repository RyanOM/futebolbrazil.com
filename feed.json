            "content_html": "<p> I meet Claiton and his family on the underground en route to Itequera, the home of Corinthians and the battle ground for not only three points but the hearts and minds of some special supporters. A friend from playing football, this is our first time watching a game together. When I told him that I was part of this blog and looking to write about supporters of different teams he immediately invited me to this fixture- an example of the hospitality extended to me from everyone I was to meet. Today is Corinthians x Bahia. Maybe not a standout fixture in many households but the game of the year for this family. Claiton relocated to Sao Paulo for work but has kept his love of EC Bahia alive from afar or, on occasions like this, by getting to the game when they come to town. With two young sons it provides a great chance for them to stay aware of their roots in the North East and keep in touch with fellow internal migrants who, for one reason or another, have ended up far from home. What better way for a father to bond with his sons than a shared love of a football team? One hitch though: Mum supports Corinthians!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>As we shoot along the red line, to the brand new Arena Corinthians, Claiton breaks the bad news to me. Pedro, his eldest, will be in the home end. The boys have attended games since before they could walk. In fact, Pedro’s first match was as a three month old attending a final in Bahia. But times have changed and here we are with him heading to his first game as a Corinthians fan. I ask Mum, Jeane, if she has any fears about her son becoming a fan of a notoriously tough “team of the working people”. The answer is no. Yes, there is a bad reputation and yes, there are some bad apples but no worse than any other team. This is a fact borne out by the swathes of families I see in and around the ground. I turn to Claiton. How does he feel about his first born choosing a team other than Bahia? He’s magnanimous if still very disappointed. As far as I’m concerned it beats him joining the masses of PSG and Barcelona supporting kids that litter every playground and football field in the country.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>And so to the game. We are joined by friends and family from both sides and make our way up the hill to the stadium. And then a twisting of the knife as Perdo gets his first Corinthians jersey. Time comes to part ways. Jeane and Perdo go their way and myself, Claiton and Garbiel, the youngest member of the family, head towards the away end. And then it happens, an act of resistance, Claiton gets Gabriel’s Bahia top out of his bag. Gabriel’s smile is as big as Dad’s and as we mingle with the fellow Bahia fans I can’t help but hope it stays this way. The sense of community and sharing of an experience is unlike any I’ve experienced at a Brazilian ground. Everyone is in it together and Gabriel is in the right place. The game ends 2-1 to Corinthians but 1-1 on children’s support. I guess a draw is a fair result no matter the score!</p>",

Flamengo needed to avoid defeat at all costs in order to keep Palmeiras within touching distance, and they were able to do that courtesy of Colombian Marlos Moreno’s equaliser after Dudu had put </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">O Verdao </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">into a second-half lead. Flamengo remain four points behind the leaders with seven games left to play.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Friday’s matches saw an out-of-sorts Sao Paulo visit Vitoria, while in Rio de Janeiro Vasco da Gama hosted Internacional. Sao Paulo desperately needed to get their faltering season back on track with a win against the strugglers from Salvador, and they had Bruno Alves to thank for their first victory in seven games - the centre-back sweeping home a cut-back in the 36th minute. It wasn’t all good news for the team in white however, as goalkeeper Jean, who previously represented Vitoria’s city rivals Bahia, was dismissed after the final whistle for provoking the home fans, sparking angry scenes on the pitch. Internacional blew the chance to move into second place as they could only manage a draw on Friday evening. Uruguayan striker Jonatan Alvez had given them the lead in the 85th minute, only for Maximiliano Lopez to score his fourth in five games with an injury-time penalty. Internacional also had a player sent-off very late on, with Edenilson receiving his second yellow card in the 95th minute of a match beset by contentious decisions from the referee.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Saturday afternoon, Santos put Fluminese to the sword with three goals in the last six minutes of their home tie at the Estadio Urbano Caldeira. Chapecoense kept themselves in the struggle to avoid the drop by beating America-MG at home - Wellington Paulista grabbing the vital goal in the 60th minute. Corinthians were able to arrest any further decline in their standing with Danilo playing a starring role from the bench and grabbing both goals in a 2-1 victory. Cruzeiro eased to a 3-1 victory over Parana, who could be relegated at the end of Round 33, if results do not go their way. Atletico-PR’s good run of form continued with a 2-1 comeback win over Botafogo, a result which sees the Rio-based team just one point above the relegation zone. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The match of the day, as far as the neutral is concerned, came at the Arena do Gremio where Sport Recife were looking to build on last week’s win against Vasco da Gama, as they seek an improbable escape from relegation. Seven goals from six different goal-scorers saw Sport throw away a two-goal lead, before regaining the advantage with Gabriel’s 53rd minute strike, only to lose it again just minutes later as Thonny Anderson equalised for Gremio. Not to be deterred, Sport kept looking for a way through, and in the 64th minute their endeavour was rewarded when Jair claimed all three points for the away side. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Monday evening, Ceara took on Atletico-MG...</span></p>",

            "content_html": "<p>The first our taxi driver notices the Flamengo strip on Matt is about 20 minutes or so of erratic driving into our trip from the Rio bus station to our hotel in Lapa. He turns around and gives the thumbs down “not good” he states in Portuguese to Matt who’s been in the country all of a week. To be fair to Matt he is more concerned about the driving than the gentle chastising he is getting for choosing the biggest club in Rio to support for his holiday. Next on the list for telling off is Lili. She has opted for a museum rather than the Fla-Flu classico. “But this is culture, this is more than a game, this is life” he states. Well, that’s why we are here. To sample culture. To enjoy life.</p>\n<p> We finally get checked into the nearest Days Inn after our brief attempt to check into a local brothel gets noticed and the situation rescued by Lili. Things they don’t tell you on trip advisor! And so we set off to the Maracana. If Brazil is some spiritual home of sexy football then the Maracana is its temple. Home of Fluminense and the setting for two world cup finals this is the stadium in South America that we’ve all heard of since childhood. We opt to get there three hours early on the advice of our taxi driver. He seems to think that it will take that long to collect our tickets and while I’m skeptical I’m aware that there will be beer and atmosphere to be soaked in. Turns out I am right. Tickets retrieved with minimal fuss it is time to grab some cans of Brama and take a walk around the old place. They say never meet your heroes and from the outside I’m beginning to think the same might be said of your favourite football satdiums. A ramshackle concrete bowl low set amongst the motorway flyovers and derelict buildings doesn’t inspire much hope. The atmosphere outside is cordial with fans mixing and enjoying drinks together and as the Rio sun scorches down (the first glimpse in over a week- sorry Matt) I’m beginning to think this might not be the worst way to spend a Saturday afternoon after all.</p>\n<p>As my third beer goes down I get to thinking about other derbies I’ve been to. In Argentina I made the pilgrimage to Monumental to see the Superclassico, River x Boca. When lists are drawn up of the must see games in life this always seems to come up top. My experience was an amazing one, being in with the Ultras and right in the midst of the flares and tifos. However, with the lack of away fans due to previous years of violence it was missing something.What’s a rivalry without a rival? The same can be said of the Sao Paulo derbies that I have attended between Palmeiras and Sao Paulo or Corinthians respectively. Full houses and full of action but no away fans leaves a surreal feeling. Maybe I’m unusual or maybe it is my upbringing but half the fun of a derby match is having your mortal enemy within yelling distance. To be able to spout range at them for 90 minutes then meet your pals from the other side for a pint after and disagree about what you’ve just seen. This brings me to the derby I was raised on and attended numerous times. For me, the best will always be the Old Firm. Anyway, here I am in Rio, with a mix of fans and an open mind. Could this be the best? Is this life? It is time to see what this derby is made of.</p>\n<p>The feeling of walking into any stadium for the first time is something special. Finding your way up the stairs, the light at the end of the tunnel, the glorious green pitch coming into sight. In this respect the Maracana doesn’t disappoint. Rejuvenated for the 2014 World Cup but not well maintained the stadium manages to mix old world charm with a comfortable viewing arena. We take our seats and watch the warm up. The stadium begins to fill and to our surprise a man selling beer comes past our seats. Having watched most of my Brazilian football in Sao Paulo’s teetotal stadiums this is a welcome surprise. My mind casts back to the stands of Parkhead and the mayhem such a scheme would cause come derby day! As more people enter we notice there is indeed an away end and a home with vocal support but unbelievably for a game of this magnitude it isn’t a sell out. The 50,000 or so that have filled into the stadium give it their best and the teams come out to fanfare and cheerleading. And here is probably as good as it gets. The game starts. Flamengo cruise to an early lead which befits their status of title challengers against their mid-table enemies. They add two more to their score sheet, each goal met with a cacophony of firecrackers. The beers keep coming as the sunsets over the Maracana. Flamengo have won and Matt is happy. As we set off to find a taxi to take us to our non-brothel hotel Matt is happy man- better than a day at the museum we agree. I wonder if our first driver of the day would still agree.</p>",

A double from Bruno Henrique was enough for the home team, Arthur replying for Ceara in the 55th minute.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Title rivals Flamengo kept the pressure on with an impressive result away at bottom side Parana. Three second-half strikes followed Lucas Paqueta’s 19th minute opener to give </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">O Mengao </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a comfortable trip back to Rio de Janeiro, and keep the gap at the top down to four points.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Saturday’s matches saw America-MG play out yet another draw, their fifth in seven games, with Gremio. The match finished 1-1 with Jean Pyerre’s penalty drawing Gremio level after Juninho scored for the hosts. Bahia took maximum points from their trip to Botafogo, courtesy of Edigar Junio’s strike just minutes after coming on as a second-half sub.

Sport Recife meanwhile earned a vital win in their attempt to avoid relegation, beating Vasco da Game 2-1 and with enough to spare to afford a 94th minute penalty miss by Gabriel.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Sunday afternoon, Vitoria hosted an out-of-form Corinthians side and played their part in an entertaining 2-2 draw, with a goal apiece scored in a frantic injury-time period. Roger thought that he had secured the win for the Sao Paulo-based side with his 91st minute strike, until Neilton snatched a point for Vitoria in the 93rd minute. Fluminese beat Atletico-MG 1-0 with Luciano scoring in the 63rd minute after Fabio Santos had missed a penalty for Atletico-MG at the start of the second half. Cruzeiro had no problem dispatching Chapecoense on Sunday evening, with three first-half goals making for an easy three points.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The round’s last fixtures saw Internacional host Santos hoping to keep within touching distance of the top two, and Ceara and Crumeabzeiro catching up on a postponed fixture. Internacional will be disappointed not to have taken all three points after leading twice in their match, but an own goal from right-back Fabiano meant the game finished 2-2. Arthur added to the goal he scored in the loss to Palmeiras, helping himself to both goals in a crucial 0-2 victory, which lifted his side from 17th to 14th and a point clear of the relegation zone with eight games to go.</span></p>",

Corinthians have now lost their last four games in all competitions, scoring just once in their past five, heaping further pressure on manager Jair Ventura who only joined the side in September. Saturday’s final fixture saw Bahia beat Parana 2-0, with a late brace from Vinicius pulling the team from the north-east clear of the relegation zone.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sunday afternoon was dominated by two fixtures involving teams in the top 6, with both matches kicking off at 4pm: Internacional hosted Sao Paulo, while Palmeiras welcomed Gremio to Allianz Parque. Sao Paulo raced into an early lead, Liziero finishing off a fine move with a clever finish, but that was as good as it got for the visitors as Internacional took control of the game and ended up comfortably winning the tie 3-1. Two goals from Leandro Damiao came before a 95th penalty from Nicolas Lopez, awarded after a clumsy challenge from Anderson Martins, which also resulted in a second yellow card for the centre-back. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Palmeiras stretched their unbeaten run to fourteen games with little drama, beating 5th placed Gremio 2-0 with Deyverson grabbing both goals. Palmeiras have conceded just three goals in the league since losing 1-0 away at Fluminese at the end of July, and it is increasingly difficult to see any way that they can be stopped from winning back the title they last held in 2016. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Sunday’s other matches, Vitoria won 0-1 away at Chapecoense to halt a four-game losing streak and drag themselves out of the relegation places. Vasco da Gama took all three points against Cruzeiro, strikes from Yago Pikachu and Maximiliano Lopez proving the difference. Atletico-PR trounced Sport Recife 4-0 with all of the goals coming in the second half. The Minas Gerais derby did not match its Rio and Sao Paulo based counterparts for entertainment, as Atletico-MG and America-MG played out a scoreless 90 minutes. Botafogo’s Monday night visit to Ceara also ended 0-0 after Arthur missed a penalty for the hosts in the 31st minute.</span></p>",

Elber had given Bahia a third minute lead, the striker’s first goal since May, and he then extended the advantage with a second goal in the 67th minute, but ten-man Bahia were unable to hold on and Gremio secured a point with Jael’s 88th minute penalty after Juninho Capixaba had given them hope with a 85th minute strike.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Monday night’s game saw Fluminese hosting, and soundly beating, the league's bottom club Parana.

Corinthians underwhelming season continued with a 0-0 draw away at America-MG on Saturday evening, while Flamengo, whose title aspirations have faded in the past few weeks, and Bahia also shut each other out.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gremio claimed the points away at Fluminese, Everton scoring deep into injury time to secure a 0-1 win. Santos left it even later to beat Atletico-PR with Carlos Sanchez scoring the decisive penalty in the 97th minute of a 1-0 victory. At the bottom end of the table, Ceara’s improved form continued with an ultimately comfortable 3-1 win over Chapecoense, which lifted them out of the relegation zone and into 15th place.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Parana were unable to capitalise on a fast start against Vasco da Gama in the last match of the round on Monday night, and had to settle for a point after Maximilliano Lopez’s penalty just before half-time cancelled out Alex Santana’s 9th minute opener.</span></p>",

            "content_html": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most football fans will have a first memory of when they fell in love with the samba football of the Brazil national team. Maybe it was the 70s teams with Pele and the boys. Perhaps it was Romario skipping it into the net in 1994, or four years later when Ronaldo and his gang knocked a ball around an airport. For me it was around 1996 when I was gifted a history of Brazilian football on VHS. That tape was worn down to the nub by the end of the year, and a love of the greats of Brazilian football was born. Somewhere on that video was grainy footage of the 1950 World Cup held in Brazil: the 199,854 people packed into the Maracana, the skills of Balthazar, Zizinho and Ademir, the heartbreak of a nation losing out to Uruguay. One of the host stadiums that year was a then 10-year-old Pacaembu. Fast-forward almost 70 years and the old stadium is still going strong. It was here that we set off to watch Santos v Gremio last Thursday. One of the great homes of Brazilian football hosting the team of Pele - what more could one want?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This was Santos’ first return to the stadium since being eliminated from the Copa Libertadores in controversial circumstances. The ensuing riot meant that police presence was high, but a friendly enough atmosphere was present inside and outside the ground. The 7pm kickoff meant that the ground slowly filled up as the first-half progressed and, to be honest, those arriving late missed very little. The same could be said if someone had rocked up after the final whistle. Bar a potential home penalty towards the end, this was a turgid late-season affair. Gremio, with title aspirations now dented, looked the more technically proficient without ever looking dangerous. The current continental champions did nothing to suggest that their exit from the competition last month was undeserved, and it leaves the race at the top with three main contenders. </span></p>",

            "content_html": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Watching your team live is unbeatable. From waking up until kick off, your day revolves around that anticipation of the match - often surpassing the quality of football on show. However, watching football in Brazil offers some vastly contrasting options when it comes to the period of time between waking up and the first ball being played - and it’s not lazy weekend mornings after one too many caipirinhas that I’m talking about here. This past week I attended two Palmeiras games; one at 11am on Sunday and one at 9.45pm on Wednesday. With scheduling that makes the complaints about Friday night football and lunchtime kick-offs in the UK look churlish, I decided to investigate what was at the root of the unorthodox timing of games.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A passionate football country, Brazil also has a guilty secret - telenovelas! For the unacquainted, think Eastenders with a touch of panache and a heap more attractiveness. A focal point of Brazilian daily life, these tend to start around 7pm and finish around 10pm. So, the land of sexy football has decided that in order to accommodate their other great televisual passion, football should make the move - an idea that a recent arrival to Sao Paulo from London greeted with enthusiasm, “Finally, a country that appreciates soaps more than football!”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I write this with heavy eyes, my visit to Allianz Parque to watch Palmeiras secure their place in the semis of the Copa Libertadores meant getting home at 12:30am, and that was without hitting a boteco to celebrate (although we did get to watch the penalties between Bahia and Botafogo in our taxi as it hurtled towards our neighborhood – note to anyone trying this….make sure your driver doesn’t support one of the teams playing as it makes for a rollercoaster of a journey home!!)</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 11am kickoff is a bit better on the sleep patterns, and brings out a more family-oriented crowd - although I think the guys behind us on the terrace took it as a chance to catch a game on the way home from a night out! The upside of this seems to be that in a country where Sunday lunch at mum’s is still a must, you can catch a game. The downside, for players and pasty faced Scots, is that the game takes place in the searing midday heat. At the Pacaembu this proved a particular problem, seeing as there is no escape on the terraces.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, the long and the short of it is that watching football in Brazil is great fun – day or night - but don’t expect much sleep!</span></p>",

            "content_html": "<p class=\"align-center\"><strong>Industrialisation, Protest and Football</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For those of us raised on the sanitised, corporate world of top-flight European football, visiting the Estadio Rodolfo Crespi feels like stepping back in time: the stark white concrete that forms the stands; the wire fence separating fans from the pitch; the repeated crowd surges towards (and indeed, up) the fence at exciting moments; the sheer lack of modernity. A trip to the working-class neighbourhood of Mooca, East of Sao Paulo’s historic centre and home to Clube Atletico Juventus, gives the thrilling sense of entering an era of football long-forgotten in other parts of the world. Nowadays, Juve ply their trade in the third tier of Sao Paulo’s state system, the Paulista Serie A3, but this humble position masks the club’s rich history and influential role in the development of this corner of Sao Paulo.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The development of the ground - a tale of immigration, industrialisation and revolt - only adds to the romantic atmosphere within. Moreover, it is a history that can be seen, visibly, not only in the past triumphs inscribed on the walls, or the plaque commemorating the scoring of Pele's greatest ever goal, but in the looming presence of the Rodolfo Crespi Cotonificio - the imposing former textiles factory that stands tall over one end of the ground despite being a substantial two blocks away.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Rodolfo Crespi was an Italian immigrant with powerful connections. Given the title 'Count' by the King of Italy, he is alleged to have counted Mussolini among his influential friends. Bringing looms to Brazil, he established the Cotonoficio in 1897: with an area of 50,000 square meters, it became one of the largest factories in Sao Paulo’s industrialisation. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Crespi's workers, many of whom were Italian, enjoyed playing football on the area of grass where the stadium now sits. In 1917, Crespi’s employees were among those to take part in Brazil’s first national strike. Indeed, there are locals who will tell you the strike’s origins can be traced to the Cotonoficio. The Italian Count’s response was to essentially hand over this piece of land to his workers, and in 1924 the club, initially taking the name of the factory, was formally established. In 1929 they reached the Campeonato Paulista, the top division of Sao Paulo football and the oldest established league in Brazil, and became Clube Atletico Juventus.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ground was initially built in the years between 1925 and 1929, with later alterations to the 4,000 capacity venue completed in 1941. It has been the home of Juve throughout their 93 years and witness to their modest success, which includes two state second division titles, a state cup and a national second division title. In addition, the Estadio has played host to a number of ‘giant killings’ for which the team has gained the nickname Moleque Travesso (the little trickster).</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For neutral observers, it is arguably more famous for the events of August 2</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">nd</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, 1959, when an eighteen-year-old Pele, playing for Santos, scored what he considers the most beautiful goal of his career (since there is no footage of the goal, Pele had a </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xD70ECy5E2k\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">digital simulation</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> made. For Juve fans, the ground is simply “Javari” after the street which houses both the stadium and the factory. Here at Futebol.Brazil, it still feels like another world.</span></p>",
