            "content_html": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With matters at the top of the table more-or-less resolved at the end of Round 37, the top three already set in stone come what may on the last day, attention turned to the scrabble to avoid the trapdoor to Serie B. With Vitoria and Parana already making plans for life outside the top flight, there were still six sides who went into the last round of games unsure of their status next season, all fighting to avoid being one of the other two </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">rebaixados.</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps the most high stakes encounter of the round was played out at the Maracana, as two sides still in the relegation mix faced off. Fluminese, the most storied of the at risk sides, made sure that the grand old stadium won’t suffer the somewhat dubious delights of second division football with a nervy 1-0 win over America-MG. Thing started well for the away side, and in the 27th minute they were rewarded for their hard work with a penalty after left-back Marlon brought down Aderlan. Luan, with just one goal to his name this season, stepped up to take it but found Julio Cesar equal to his attempt. The goal that secured Fluminese’s status, and ultimately condemned America-MG to return to the league they won last season, came fourteen minutes later courtesy of an excellent corner delivered by Marlon, more than making up for his earlier rash challenge. Richard made no mistake as he met the ball just outside the six-yard box, powering his header past Joao Ricardo. Ceara and Vasco da Gama were also both candidates for the drop and final day opponents, but with both sides knowing that a point would more than likely be enough it was little surprise that their tie ended 0-0. There was little to cheer for either set of fans, the sides mustering up just four shots on target between them, but everyone went home happy once events elsewhere confirmed that they will meet again next year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Chapecoense and Sport Recife rounded out the group of six, with the former holding their fate in their own hands and the latter relying on the results of others to give them a chance of escape. Chapecoense faced a Sao Paulo side that have looked increasingly desperate for the season to end over the last few weeks, lest they fall any further from the lofty heights they commanded for so much of the season. They still had something to play for themselves, with the chance to move into fourth spot and automatic qualification for the Libertadores on the table, although the more conspiracy-minded fans of </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">O Tricolor</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> would have looked at the fixture list and suspected that Corinthians were unlikely to do them any favours in the attempt to better Gremio’s result when they played the fourth-placed side down in Rio Grande do Sul. As it was, the outcome of that match hardly mattered as Sao Paulo slumped to a 1-0 defeat and a season that promised so much became yet another one to forget. In the 68th minute, Leandro Pereira headed in the winning goal from a looped ball into the box, sparking scenes of delight in the crowd. This was followed by a nervous 25 minutes until the team that had just four days earlier commemorated the second anniversary of the tragic air disaster that robbed them of the most successful squad in their history could confirm their place in next season’s top division. Sport Recife faced Santos at home knowing that nothing short of a win would do. To their credit, they fulfilled their part of the requirement, beating their guests 2-1 following goals from Rogerio and Hernane, with Rodrygo pulling one back for Santos, however with the results in the round’s other ties not going their way all of their hard work counted for naught and they ultimately finished a point, and a more than a few hatfuls of goals, behind sixteenth-placed Vasco.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">At Allianz Parque, the title celebrations were in full swing before kick-off and events on the pitch were of secondary importance to the trophy presentation after the match. As it was, the champions did what they have done all season and won at home, their only home loss of the season coming way back in May against Sport Recife, beating Vitoria 3-2. After taking a two goal lead, the hosts were pegged back by two goals in quick succession before Bruno Henrique put the icing on the championship-winning cake with a sweet strike from outside the area in the 90th minute. Those Sao Paulo fans who suspected that Corinthians wouldn’t exactly exert themselves in their match against Gremio will feel their suspicions were well placed as Jael headed in from close range after 12 minutes as Cassio flapped at a deflected shot. Corinthians supporters will surely point to their team’s poor form this season and the fact that they were playing a superior side as the reasons their side only managed one shot on and one shot off target in 90 minutes, although this is unlikely to change the minds of their aggrieved rival fans.      </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elsewhere, Parana managed to exit the stage with a semblance of pride, despite ending the season with just 23 points. A 1-1 draw with third-placed Internacional suggests that it might not be too long until the team from Curitiba make a return to the top flight. Two teams with nothing to play for and at least one eye on the beach before the state championships begin met in Salvador as Bahia played host to Cruzeiro. A game to forget ended 0-0 with the home side not even able to muster up the enthusiasm to get a shot on target. For reasons that aren’t quite clear, the last round of games did not all take place on Sunday. On Saturday night, Atletico-PR took a very creditable three point off Flamengo as they beat this year’s runners up 1-2 on their home turf. After falling behind to a 23rd minute Rholdolfo goal, second half strikes from Mateus Rossetto and Rony meant that the club from Parana end the season unbeaten in eight games. A degree of shine was taken off the achievement as Willian Arao of Flamengo and goal scorer Rony were both sent off late on. A poor challenge on the Atletico-PR forward earned Arao his second yellow before Rony reacted impetuously to provocation from Fernando Uribe by throwing out his shoulder at the striker. Also on Saturday night, Juan Cazares 18th minute goal meant that Atletico-MG beat Botafogo 1-0 and finished in sixth place, earning themselves a Libertadores playoff spot in the process.  </span></p>",

            "content_html": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Palmeiras were crowned champions of the Brasileirao in a double game week where they claimed their 21st and 22nd victories of the season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The only thing to take a degree of shine off this moment for the team in green and white was the fact that their title win was confirmed in the environs of the Estadio Club de Regatas, rather than in front of their own fans, although many made the journey up to Rio in the hope of seeing their side confirm themselves as this year’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">campeoes. </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They were made to wait for their moment until the weekend despite sweeping aside America-MG 4-0 on Wednesday evening, as Flamengo gamely continued their ultimately fruitless attempt to haul in the leaders by beating Gremio 2-0. Sao Paulo had a golden opportunity on Thursday evening to leapfrog Gremio into fourth spot only to blow it by losing 2-0 away to Vasco da Gama. Internacional had also lost 1-2 at home to Atletico-MG the night before, so the status quo at the top was maintained for another round. Elsewhere on Wednesday, Santos and Botafogo drew 1-1, while Corinthians slipped to defeat 15 of the season, losing 1-0 away at Atletico-PR. On Thursday evening, Chapecoense earned vital points as they beat Sport Recife 2-1. Bahia took full points from Fluminese, winning 2-0, while Ceara eeked past Parana 1-0.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The penultimate round of the season kicked off in some style on Saturday evening as Santos hosted Atletico-MG. Uruguayan midfielder Carlos Santos got Santos off to a very quick start, scoring a fantastic free-kick after just 97 seconds. Not to be deterred, Atletico-MG struck back with a long range effort of their own, Ricardo Oliveria driving a low shot in off the post in the 17th minute. Seventeen minutes later and Santos were back in front: Felippe Cardoso finishing from close range after a give-and-go. Gabriel then got his 18th goal of the season in similar circumstances to put his team 3-1 ahead at the interval. Seven minutes after the break, the Santos defence had a moment to forget as goalkeeper Vanderlei managed to misjudge the flight of a corner allowing Ricardo Oliveira to grab his second of the game. Atletico-MG continued to press but to no avail, and Santos were able to hang on for maximum points despite having goal-scorer Carlos Santos dismissed in the 77th minute. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the pre-show entertainment over, all eyes turned to Sunday’s fixtures, and in particular Palmeiras’ visit to Vasco da Gama. Vasco, buoyed by their midweek win over Sao Paulo, were in no mood to make it easy for </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Os Porcos</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and frustrated the visitors until midway through the second half. When it came, the goal that won the league was delivered from very close range. A long ball over the top of the Vasco defence was touched into the path of Deyverson who had the easiest of tasks to stroke home his ninth and most important goal of the season. With this win, it didn’t matter what happened in Flamengo’s game away at Cruzeiro, but the they secured second place with a 0-2 win - both goals coming from Everton Ribeiro and both worthy of winning a title rather than finishing runner up. The first was a smart finish from an acute angle after beating a couple of static Cruzeiro players; the second a wonderful strike from outside the area. The other two 5pm ties ended in draws: Vitoria and Gremio played out a 0-0, which meant that Sao Paulo were given another chance to go into the last round of games in fourth place if they could beat Sport Recife on Monday evening. The result was even less desirable for Vitoria as it confirmed that they will be joining Parana in Serie B next season. Atletico-PR and Ceara put on a much better show for the crowd as their match ended 2-2. Ceara went into half-time a goal to the good after Leandro Carvalho met a long ball over the top with a volley across Felipe Alves and into the bottom corner of the Atletico-PR net. The second half saw the home side draw level and then take the lead in the 58th minute - goals coming from Marcinho and Lucho Gonzalez - only for Ceara to restore parity when Wescley pick up on a poor clearance from Jose Ivaldo to slot the ball past Everson.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 7pm kick offs saw America-MG claim an absolutely vital win, one which ensured that their destiny will not be decided until the last day. Juninho’s 47th minute scuffed effort won’t win any goal of the season awards, but it might be the most important of the season for his team. Bahia then had centre-back Tiago Pagnussant sent off for a second bookable offence with three minutes left of regular time. Internacional cemented their third place finish as they beat Fluminese 2-0. Nicolas Lopez got both goals: the first, in the 75th minute, was a brilliant volley into the top corner from the edge of the Fluminese area following a headed clearance; the second, fourteen minutes later, was a much more routine affair as he reached Andres D’Alessandro’s through ball and finished calmly, placing the ball under the out-rushing Rodolfo. Corinthians’ dreadful season managed to muster up the strength to keep Chapecoense at bay for 90 minutes, although any meaningful attempts to score were few and far between and resulted in just one shot on goal for the home side. The point was enough to ensure that the reigning champions won’t suffer the ignominy of competing in the second division next season, but time must surely be running out for </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">treinador </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Jair Ventura. Chapecoense, meanwhile, have given themselves every chance of staying up when they host Sao Paulo next weekend.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Monday evening saw Round 37 complete as Botafogo hosted Parana and Sao Paulo took on Sport Recife at the Morumbi stadium. There was little to play for but professional honour in Rio as Botafogo sat firmly in mid-table while Parana’s relegation was confirmed at the end of Round 32. In the end, they served up more entertainment that expected with two goals for Botafogo's Erik sandwiching a strike from Parana's Alex Santana. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sao Paulo still had fourth place and an automatic Libertadores spot firmly in their sights, and knew that a win against 18th placed Sport Recife would go a long way towards achieving that aim. Sport themselves had even more to play for as a win would take them up a place and level with Chapecoense in their battle to stay in the division. Neither side, therefore, will have been pleased with the point they took away from their stalemate. Sao Paulo now need to better Gremio's final day result, while Sport must hope for a win at home to Santos and for results elsewhere to go their way in order to maintain their position in the top flight. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">    </span></p>",

            "content_html": "<p>When I found out that I was moving to Sao Paulo the first thing I knew I had to research was the football teams at my disposal and pick one to start going to. A Celtic season ticket holder until I began travelling the world, I had gone eight years without really having a local team to call my own. In China I had been to a few Shanghai Shenhua games and had the chance to watch Nicholas Anelka play defensive midfield, something not many people have had the comic fortune to witness. In Slovakia I chose to play rather than attend games, so before coming to Brazil I was going to right a wrong and start following a team for real again. Sao Paulo is a city rich in football history and success so surely I was going to find a team to follow. In those years away from regular attendance something had certainly been missing. Yes, there is something fun about meeting up with a bunch of Glaswegians in a dingy Shanghai pub in the wee hours of the morning to watch a dodgy stream but something was always lacking. The sights and sounds of game day are things that make the game all the more enjoyable. The way to the stadium, the meeting of friends, the habitual pint in the same old pub (a war zone on an off day and a paradise of stale beer and pregame analysis on those halcyon afternoons). These were the things I’d been missing and was looking to find. But where?</p>\n<p> Within a one-hour circumference of the city (make that 1-12 hours depending on the crazy traffic here) you can see four of the nation’s big teams: by the seaside, outside the city, you have home of Pele; Santos. As well as the Brazilian legend they can count Neymar and Rodrygo amongst their recent alumni and won the Libertadores in 2011. In the North of the city there is Palmeiras the most successful team in terms of Brasileirao championships; West is Sao Paulo FC who gave Kaka a start in the game and play their games in the 72,000 capacity Estadio Morumbi where the opening ceremony of the Copa America 2019 will be held; and to the East, Corinthians, the “team of the people” that conquered Chelsea in the 2012 FIFA World Club Cup competition. But who to support?</p>\n<p> Picking a team isn’t something you really do as an adult. Most football fans will have had their team since a young age. Maybe family influenced, maybe the team of the day, maybe a moral or a style choice. Whatever the reason you will have chosen young and then stuck with it. For this reason I’ve seen some ups and some downs following Celtic through the 80s, 90s and beyond. The pleasure of those years was the emotional attachment; the sense of belonging. Going to a local “non-dom” primary school could be agonizing as Rangers waltzed to 9-in-a-row however the joy of winning the league in ’98 was magnified through the prism of that pain. Now, as a fully-grown adult, I was about to choose a team to cheer on in a language that I barely understood. Was it possible to find a team to share the same connection with?</p>\n<p>A bit of research was in order and so I set about picking my Brazilian team. A simple scan of Google images got me on the right path. For someone with a deep-rooted love of my home club it may seem a bit facile to choose a team to support based on the colour of their strip but with only 20kg of luggage to haul with me it was handy when you could mix and match your kits! So, Palmeiras it was. Looking beyond the superficial, the decision actually made more sense. Both clubs founded by immigrants to represent a minority of society (Irish in Scotland and Italian in Brazil). Both clubs with passionate and vocal fans. Both are clubs with a history of playing attacking and exciting football. I’d found a new football home. But surely my passion couldn’t be the same as for the club I supported as a boy?</p>\n<p> Well, three seasons down the line I can count myself as being on the way to being a Porco (the club nickname- a denigration of the Italian community embraced as a badge of honour by the fans). Of course it’s a work in progress. Slowly but surely I’m building up a friend group of fellow fans. Slowly learning the songs and feeling less like an outsider. Gradually feeling like I belong in this new family. And the Palmereise have helped this process of assimilation. If I ever turn up to a game in the hoops then invariably I will be stopped and asked about Celtic and why I’m here by people keen to share their love of Palmeiras. Nothing quite matches your first team but I feel I’ve made a good choice for my life in Brazil. Then again everything looks good through green and white tinted spectacles!</p>",

            "content_html": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Round 34 took place midweek, and saw league leaders Palmeiras comfortably beat Fluminese 3-0. Internacional kept up the pressure with on the table toppers with a 2-0 victory over America-MG. Sao Paulo’s first match in the post-Diego Aguirre era ended in a 1-1 draw with Gremio, a result which further maintained the status quo at the top of the league. Parana couldn’t repeat the heroics of last weekend, but will heart from only losing 0-1 to Libertadores hopefuls Atletico-MG. Bahia’s 2-1 win over Ceara is probably enough to see them safe as they moved on to 44 points, meanwhile Sport and Vitoria would both have felt no better about their respective situations following their 0-0 draw. Corinthians fans must be longing for the end of the season as they had to endure yet another defeat, their 14th of the season, losing 1-0 away at Cruzeiro. Botafogo made it three wins on the spin, beating Chapecoense 0-1, and Flamengo won by the same scoreline at home against Santos to keep themselves in the race for the title. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Round 35, Palmeiras’ fortunate habit of timing their missteps to match those of their top of the table rivals continued on Sunday, as they could only manage a draw away at Serie B-bound Parana, a blow to their title ambitions that was softened considerably by the news which filtered into the stadium that second placed Internacional had lost away at mid-table also-rans Botafogo. It was Parana who took the lead in the 35th minute of a rain-swept encounter: Keslley poking a low cross past a sprawling Weverton. Parana are experiencing something of a post-relegation bounce, given their woeful form for most of this season, but they were not able to keep Palmeiras completely at bay here and early in the second half they gave away a penalty after Willian’s goal-bound shot was handled in the area. There were to be no more goals under the grey Londrina sky, but a point against this season’s likely league champions will have felt like a victory for the home team. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over in Rio de Janiero, Internacional did their best to ensure that Palmeiras could sleep easy, slumping to a 0-1 loss against Botafogo following Erik’s smart 42nd minute finish; the right-sided winger bringing the ball under control with his chest, wrong-footing Zeca in the process, before slamming the ball home. Things did not improve for the away side in the second half, and the bad became farcical in injury-time as first Wellington Silva then Rodrigo Moledo were dismissed. Silva received a straight red for retaliation following a heavy tackle from behind by Rodrigo Pimpao, while Moledo can feel himself fortunate to have got away with a second yellow card after he pushed the referee when his penalty appeals were turned down.      </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the top two faltered, Flamengo grasped the opportunity to move into second place with a tight 0-1 victory over Sport Recife. Despite having Lucas Paqueta sent off for a second bookable offence in the 61st minute, Flamengo kept the pressure up and were rewarded for their endeavour when Willian Arao beat his marker just inside the 6-yard box to head past Mailson. In the battle for the fourth automatic Libertadores spot, both Gremio and Sao Paulo took maximum points in their home ties against Chapecoense and Cruzeiro respectively. Cicero met a high ball into the box to put Gremio one up after 24 minutes, with Everton beating Jandrei to a defence-splitting pass and lifting the ball over the goalkeeper to make it 2-0 in the 75th minute. Sao Paulo’s caretaker-manager, Andre Jardine, has the first win of his attempt to stake a claim to the job full-time. Diego Souza got the decisive goal, finishing acrobatically after Nene’s corner was headed into the ground by Robert Arboleda.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sunday also saw America-MG clinch a crucial win at the other end of the table, beating Santos 2-1 with goals from Rafael Moura and Matheusinho either side of the 17th goal of the season for the league’s </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">melhor marcador</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Gabriel. The win moved America-MG up two places to 17th, and within touching distance of safety. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Saturday evening, Corinthians overcame a determined Vasco da Gama side 1-0 after Mateus Vital headed powerfully past Fernando Miguel from Fagner’s high hanging cross. A late Neilton penalty wasn’t enough to save Vitoria from defeat against Atletico-PR, and things are looking bleak for the team from Bahia as they are now winless in six and have a significantly worse goal difference than the other teams in the relegation zone. It was a bad day all round for the home side. Atletico-PR’s opening goal was gifted to them as Ramon got himself into a mix and ended up putting the ball in his own net after Marcelo Cirino’s header was palmed onto the post by Vitoria keeper, Joao Gabriel. They were also reduced to ten-men in the 89th minute when Jeferson received his second yellow card of the match. In Belo Horizonte, Bahia left disappointed that they could not make numbers count as they lost 1-0 to an Atletico-MG side who had Fabio Santos sent off in the 53rd minute. Just two minutes earlier, Juan Cazares had given Atletico-MG the lead with what turned out to be the winning goal, setting himself up for a wonderful half-volley from the edge of the Bahia box following Yimmi Chara’s cutback.   </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Monday evening saw two out-of-form teams in the shape of Fluminese and Ceara battling to keep themselves clear of the drop zone. A draw was always the most likely result, and so it proved to be with both teams failing to find a way through in a game of few chances. With three matches left to play, neither side will be taking anything for granted, but a point and a clean sheet was a satisfactory outcome for all involved. </span></p>",

            "content_html": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Palmeiras’ seemingly inexorable march to the title faltered slightly on Sunday evening as they could only manage a draw away at an out-of-sorts Atletico-MG. A well worked move down the left was finished in spectacular style by Elias as he teed himself up to volley the ball into the top corner past a helpless Weverton, giving Atletico-MG the lead just under half-way through the second half. It took a good save from the Palmeiras goalkeeper to stop Luan making it two just minutes later, as he found space in the area after a give-and-go with Fabio Santos and unleashed a stinging low shot. It was Palmeiras, however, who got a rub of the green as they were awarded a soft penalty after Adilson was adjudged to have pulled back Edu Dracena in the 77th minute. Bruno Henrique duly scored a perfectly placed penalty, sending Victor the wrong way and the ball into the bottom right-hand corner, ensuring that that his team took another step towards the title. This step was made all the more comfortable by the news that in the north-east of the country Internacional were unable to capitalise on an early lead against Ceara, ending up with a 1-1 draw of their own. Leandro Damiao’s sixth goal in six games, finishing after Everson had blocked his initial shot, gave Palmeiras’ closest rivals the lead, before Ricardinho levelled matters in the 42nd minute, converting a low cross from close range. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Estadio Manoel Barradas played host to the weekend’s third derby, following Saturday’s ties, as Vitoria and Bahia played their roles in an entertaining 2-2 draw. The hosts Vitoria were twice pegged back as they went in search of a vital win and a chance to move out of the relegation zone. Bahia are much more comfortably placed in mid-table, six points above trouble, and this will certainly feel like two-points lost for Paulo Carpegiani’s struggling team. In Porto Alegre, Gremio snatched a win thanks to Matheus Henrique’s 95th minute goal. Thiago Galhardo finished off a break-away move to put Vasco in front on 12 minutes, only for Jael to equalise eight minutes later, heading in unmarked at the far post. Seventy five goalless minutes then followed until Matheus Henrique’s decisive contribution: an ambitious long range shot, which should have been dealt with easily but instead was fumbled into the net by Vasco’s Uruguayan #1, Martin Silva. Sunday’s action was rounded off by Sport Recife’s visit to Rio to meet Fluminese. Sport have enjoyed a great run of form in recent weeks, winning four of their last five, and will have arrived at the Maracana hopeful of another good result as they faced a side who have lost their last two without scoring. A goalless first half was followed by a scoreless second, however, and both teams had to settle for a point, a result which kept Sport Recife out of the bottom four, at least until Chapecoense play on Monday evening. Fluminese came closest to breaking the deadlock, and had the ball in the net late on after Luciano’s close-range finish, only for the assistant referee to flag it up as offside.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Saturday’s match-ups saw derby action in both Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro as Flamengo visited Botafogo and Corinthians hosted city rivals Sao Paulo. Given their poor run of form recently, Corinthians gave a good account of themselves, holding Diego Aguirre’s team to a 1-1 draw despite going down to ten men shortly before the interval. Chilean midfielder Angelo Araos was sent-off for a second bookable offence when he hit out after a coming together with Reinaldo. In fact it was Corinthians who took the lead, Ralf on target with a low drive from distance after 72 minutes, but Sao Paulo finally made their numbers count as Brenner equalised nine minutes later, directing Nene’s goalbound shot past Cassio. Up the coast in Rio, Botafogo earned an important three points in a bad tempered 2-1 victory. Ten yellow cards were shown as goals from Erik and Leonardo Valencia earned the points for the team in black and white. Vitinho nodded in a reply for Flamengo early in the second half, but Botafogo did enough to hang on for the win.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Saturday’s other matches were similarly marked by ill-discipline. Both sides ended the match with ten men as already-relegated Parana visited America-MG. Parana’s Rene was the first to see red before Messias was also sent marching in the 86th minute. The match is likely to be remembered for more positive reasons however, by half of those concerned at least, as a 0-1 win for Parana ended a winless streak stretching all the way back to July. Atletico-PR and Cruzeiro went one better than the Rio derby as eleven players were booked in their encounter. Marcelo Cirino and Raphael Veiga’s first half goals were enough to secure the points for Atletico-PR, a win which lifted them into 6th place and the Libertadores qualifying round spots.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Monday night football was provided by Chapecoense’s visit to Santos, as the away team looked to leapfrog their relegation rivals into 16th place.  </span></p>",

            "content_html": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Palmeiras took a huge stride towards securing the title on Saturday evening as they came out on top in an exciting 3-2 win over Santos. This looked to be a tricky tie for the leaders, with Santos on a good run of form and the team in green still nursing a potential hangover after their midweek semi-final exit from the Copa Libertadores at the hands of Boca Juniors. If they were feeling tired after their exertions against the Argentines, they showed no sign in the first half as they went into the interval two goals to the good, courtesy of Dudu and Edu Dracena. With the game very much in their grasp, things took a turn when Jonathan Copete clawed one back for Santos on 55 minutes. Ten minutes later and it was game on as Dodo levelled for </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">O Peixe. </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The lead was not to last, however, as Vitor Luis grabbed the winning goal from a free-kick in the 71st minute. There was still time for more drama as Santos’ Diego Pituca picked up a second yellow card and was dismissed ten minutes from time.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Saturday’s other games were not quite so dramatic. Gremio and Vasco da Gama both winning 0-1 away at Atletico-MG and Fluminese respectively. Pedro Geromel struck early for Gremio, while Maxi Lopez’s fine run of form continued with his fifth goal in his last six games. Atletico-MG had Ecuador midfield Junior Sornoza dismissed deep into injury time to compound the loss.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sunday afternoon saw fourth host second as Sao Paulo welcomed Flamengo to the Morumbi. Like Saturday’s main attraction, this clash between two of this season’s title contenders didn’t disappoint with four goals and leads won and lost. Diego Souza opened the scoring for Sao Paulo with his eleventh goal of the season, only for the hosts to be pegged back two minutes later as Fernando Uribe netted an equaliser in the tenth minute. After the break, Helio Junio must have though he’d done enough to secure all three points for Sao Paulo, only for Rodinei to score in the 80th minute and draw the team from Rio level once again. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The other big game on Saturday took place in Porto Alegre as Internacional faced Atletico-PR. A win would move the home team up to second place, but for most of the match it looked like it would be another missed opportunity for Odair Hellmann’s team as Camancho scored for Atletico-PR in the 62nd minute. Rodrigo Moledo equalised in the 82nd minute, and it looked like Internacional would have to settle for a point, but they were awarded a 94th minute penalty, which was duly converted by Andres D’Alessandro. His team are now just five points behind Palmeiras with six games left to play. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elsewhere, Parana and Vitoria played out a 1-1 draw, which did neither side any favours in their battle against the drop, but did halt a run of four successive losses for the league’s bottom side. Parana are now winless in 18 games, and Serie B bound barring a miracle involving a run of six successive wins and a serious goal difference overhaul. America-MG also remain in imminent danger of the drop as they failed to pick up any points at home to Cruzeiro, losing 1-2 on the night.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Remarkably, last season’s champions Corinthians are still not out of danger and a couple more results like Sunday evening’s loss to Botafogo may well see </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">O Timao</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> sweating over results elsewhere. Rodrigo Lindoso scored the only goal of the game for the hosts, a result which pulled Botafogo further clear of the relegation zone. Bahia condemned Chapecoense to defeat by the same scoreline, Elber getting the vital goal and helping his team to the relative comfort of 11th place while leaving Chapecoense firmly in the drop zone.  </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Monday evening, Sport Recife continued their recent renaissance with a narrow win over fellow strugglers Ceara. Gabriel scored the all important goal in the 53rd minute, helping his side to their fourth win in the last five games and, most importantly, lifting them out of the bottom four.</span></p>",

            "content_html": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s 8 am on a Sunday morning and the sun is shining brightly on the crowd outside the ‘Onion bar’ in Mooca, a barrio in the Central-West district of Sao Paulo. The Onion is home to Sector 2, a group of C.A. Juventus fans who have welcomed me with open arms since I first found my way to a Juve game around a year ago. A group of around 40 or so fans have gathered here to take the two-hour bus ride North to Atibaia, a conurbation of around 125,000 people, for an important game in the Copa Paulista (a tournament for sides in the state of Sao Paulo who are not part of the national set-up).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Away games for Juventus are usually within city limits (and reachable by public transport) or several hundred kilometres away.  As a result, bus trips such as these are somewhat rare and excitement levels are high: many of the beers marked for consumption en route have already disappeared and large glasses of industrial-flavoured cachaca are doing the rounds. Everyone is in high spirits. But weren’t we supposed to be leaving already? The bus driver seems to be the only one keen to get going. Eventually, more beers and ice arrive, the big bass drum is loaded onto the bus and we are on our way.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The party starts immediately and for a Sunday morning I must say it is a sight, and sound, to behold.  For the duration of the journey, the seats are treated like the terraces at Rua Javari, Juventus’ home, as the group bounce and sway through a repertoire of songs seemingly aimed at insulting every other club in Sao Paulo one after the other.  Moving slowly through the notorious city traffic, the bus is greeted with no shortage of honks, cheers and waves from passers-by. Heavy smoke fills the air, thankfully masking the smell from the toilet (passengers who force their way through the throng are urged not to flush for fear of making it worse), the drum beat pounds away and as we make our way into the countryside, light fittings and luggage racks begin to fall from the ceiling, much to the amusement of those underneath. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As we approach Atibaia, I check the time on my phone and am alarmed to note that kick-off time was 15 minutes ago! I turn to inform Joao, stood next to me, but he simply beams at me as he puts his arm around my shoulder: ‘Yes we are missing the game,’ he chuckles, ‘but we knew this would happen before we left The Onion.’ It takes me a few moments to process this. I glance around at the swaying, smiling, care-free faces in front of me and am reminded of a familiar feeling I have experienced many times before in situations such as these: sure, the game is important, but there is something more powerful here, a togetherness, a bond formed by the collective expression of emotion that occurs when passionate people gather together over something they love. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I feel this sensation once more when, after the game, I remark to Fernando, one of the leaders of Sector 2, how well Juventus played today. “Yeah?” he replies, looking vaguely pleased with this suggestion, for he has no idea what happened on the pitch. Like others around him, his match was spent facing his fellow supporters, bouncing up and down, arms pumping rhythmically in time with the chanting. Expressing his love for the beautiful game.</span></p>",

            "content_html": "<p>I meet Claiton and his family on the underground en-route to Itaquera, the home of Corinthians and the battle ground for not only three points but the hearts and minds of some special supporters. A friend from playing football, this is our first time watching a game together. When I told him that I was part of this blog and looking to write about supporters of different teams, he immediately invited me to this fixture - an example of the hospitality extended to me from everyone I was to meet. Today is Corinthians x Bahia. Maybe not a standout fixture in many households, but the game of the year for this family. Claiton relocated to Sao Paulo for work, but has kept his love of EC Bahia alive from afar or, on occasions like this, by getting to the game when they come to town. With two young sons, it provides a great chance for them to stay aware of their roots in the North-East and keep in touch with fellow internal migrants who, for one reason or another, have ended up far from home. What better way for a father to bond with his sons than a shared love of a football team? One hitch though: Mum supports Corinthians!</p>\n<p>As we shoot along the red line to the brand new Arena Corinthians, Claiton breaks the bad news to me. Pedro, his eldest, will be in the home end. The boys have attended games since before they could walk. In fact, Pedro’s first match was as a three month old attending a final in Bahia. But times have changed and here we are with him heading to his first game as a Corinthians fan. I ask Mum, Jeane, if she has any fears about her son becoming a fan of a notoriously tough “team of the working people”. The answer is no. Yes, there is a bad reputation and yes, there are some bad apples but no worse than any other team. This is a fact borne out by the swathes of families I see in and around the ground. I turn to Claiton. How does he feel about his first born choosing a team other than Bahia? He’s magnanimous if still very disappointed. As far as I’m concerned it beats him joining the masses of PSG and Barcelona supporting kids that litter every playground and football field in the country.</p>\n<p>And so to the game. We are joined by friends and family from both sides and make our way up the hill to the stadium. And then a twisting of the knife, as Pedro gets his first Corinthians jersey. Time comes to part ways. Jeane and Pedro go their way and myself, Claiton and Gabriel, the youngest member of the family, head towards the away end. And then it happens, an act of resistance, Claiton gets Gabriel’s Bahia top out of his bag. Gabriel’s smile is as big as Dad’s, and as we mingle with the fellow Bahia fans I can’t help but hope it stays this way. The sense of community and sharing of an experience is unlike any I’ve experienced at a Brazilian ground. Everyone is in it together and Gabriel is in the right place. Clinging to Dad, Gabriel soaks in the atmosphere, a mix of giddy excitement and awe on his face. Although a brand new stadium, the Arena Corinthians is quite open to the elements and as the drizzle becomes rain, a lady behind Claiton offers to shelter Gabriel from the elements. Again the sense of belonging, of being one of the family, shines through despite the miserable weather. A notorious venue for boisterous home fans, the game's noise and action heats up as the game goes on and it  finishes in a crescendo of goals in the final few minutes. It ends 2-1 to Corinthians and they jump ahead of Bahia in the league. However, the real result that matters is that of who the boys have chosen to support. That ends 1-1. I guess a draw is a fair result, no matter the score!</p>",

Flamengo needed to avoid defeat at all costs in order to keep Palmeiras within touching distance, and they were able to do that courtesy of Colombian Marlos Moreno’s equaliser after Dudu had put </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">O Verdao </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">into a second-half lead. Flamengo remain four points behind the leaders with seven games left to play.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Friday’s matches saw an out-of-sorts Sao Paulo visit Vitoria, while in Rio de Janeiro Vasco da Gama hosted Internacional. Sao Paulo desperately needed to get their faltering season back on track with a win against the strugglers from Salvador, and they had Bruno Alves to thank for their first victory in seven games - the centre-back sweeping home a cut-back in the 36th minute. It wasn’t all good news for the team in white however, as goalkeeper Jean, who previously represented Vitoria’s city rivals Bahia, was dismissed after the final whistle for provoking the home fans, sparking angry scenes on the pitch. Internacional blew the chance to move into second place as they could only manage a draw on Friday evening. Uruguayan striker Jonatan Alvez had given them the lead in the 85th minute, only for Maximiliano Lopez to score his fourth in five games with an injury-time penalty. Internacional also had a player sent-off very late on, with Edenilson receiving his second yellow card in the 95th minute of a match beset by contentious decisions from the referee.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Saturday afternoon, Santos put Fluminese to the sword with three goals in the last six minutes of their home tie at the Estadio Urbano Caldeira. Chapecoense kept themselves in the struggle to avoid the drop by beating America-MG at home - Wellington Paulista grabbing the vital goal in the 60th minute. Corinthians were able to arrest any further decline in their standing with Danilo playing a starring role from the bench and grabbing both goals in a 2-1 victory. Cruzeiro eased to a 3-1 victory over Parana, who could be relegated at the end of Round 33, if results do not go their way. Atletico-PR’s good run of form continued with a 2-1 comeback win over Botafogo, a result which sees the Rio-based team just one point above the relegation zone. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The match of the day, as far as the neutral is concerned, came at the Arena do Gremio where Sport Recife were looking to build on last week’s win against Vasco da Gama, as they seek an improbable escape from relegation. Seven goals from six different goal-scorers saw Sport throw away a two-goal lead, before regaining the advantage with Gabriel’s 53rd minute strike, only to lose it again just minutes later as Thonny Anderson equalised for Gremio. Not to be deterred, Sport kept looking for a way through, and in the 64th minute their endeavour was rewarded when Jair claimed all three points for the away side. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On Monday evening, Ceara took on Atletico-MG and secured a vital 2-1 win to put daylight between themselves as the teams at the bottom of the table. Juninho Quixada and Leandro Carvalho got the goals that moved their side up to 13th place. </span></p>",

To be fair to Matt he is more concerned about the driving than the gentle chastising he is getting for choosing the biggest club in Rio to support for his holiday. Next on the list for telling off is Lili. She has opted for a museum rather than the Fla-Flu classico. “But this is culture, this is more than a game, this is life” he states. Well, that’s why we are here. To sample culture.

Things they don’t tell you on trip advisor! And so we set off to the Maracana. If Brazil is some spiritual home of sexy football then the Maracana is its temple. Home of Fluminense and the setting for two world cup finals this is the stadium in South America that we’ve all heard of since childhood. We opt to get there three hours early on the advice of our taxi driver. He seems to think that it will take that long to collect our tickets and while I’m skeptical I’m aware that there will be beer and atmosphere to be soaked in. Turns out I am right. Tickets retrieved with minimal fuss it is time to grab some cans of Brahma and take a walk around the old place. They say never meet your heroes and from the outside I’m beginning to think the same might be said of your favourite football satdiums. A ramshackle concrete bowl low set amongst the motorway flyovers and derelict buildings doesn’t inspire much hope. The atmosphere outside is cordial with fans mixing and enjoying drinks together and as the Rio sun scorches down (the first glimpse in over a week- sorry Matt) I’m beginning to think this might not be the worst way to spend a Saturday afternoon after all.</p>\n<p>As my third beer goes down I get to thinking about other derbies I’ve been to. In Argentina I made the pilgrimage to Monumental to see the Superclassico, River x Boca. When lists are drawn up of the must see games in life this always seems to come up top. My experience was an amazing one, being in with the Ultras and right in the midst of the flares and tifos. However, with the lack of away fans due to previous years of violence it was missing something.What’s a rivalry without a rival? The same can be said of the Sao Paulo derbies that I have attended between Palmeiras and Sao Paulo or Corinthians respectively. Full houses and full of action but no away fans leaves a surreal feeling. Maybe I’m unusual or maybe it is my upbringing but half the fun of a derby match is having your mortal enemy within yelling distance. To be able to spout range at them for 90 minutes then meet your pals from the other side for a pint after and disagree about what you’ve just seen. This brings me to the derby I was raised on and attended numerous times. For me, the best will always be the Old Firm. Anyway, here I am in Rio, with a mix of fans and an open mind. Could this be the best? Is this life? It is time to see what this derby is made of.</p>\n<p>The feeling of walking into any stadium for the first time is something special. Finding your way up the stairs, the light at the end of the tunnel, the glorious green pitch coming into sight. In this respect the Maracana doesn’t disappoint. Rejuvenated for the 2014 World Cup but not well maintained the stadium manages to mix old world charm with a comfortable viewing arena. We take our seats and watch the warm up. The stadium begins to fill and to our surprise a man selling beer comes past our seats. Having watched most of my Brazilian football in Sao Paulo’s teetotal stadiums this is a welcome surprise. My mind casts back to the stands of Parkhead and the mayhem such a scheme would cause come derby day! As more people enter we notice there is indeed an away end and a home with vocal support but unbelievably for a game of this magnitude it isn’t a sell out. The 50,000 or so that have filled into the stadium give it their best and the teams come out to fanfare and cheerleading. And here is probably as good as it gets. The game starts. Flamengo cruise to an early lead which befits their status of title challengers against their mid-table enemies. They add two more to their score sheet, each goal met with a cacophony of firecrackers. The beers keep coming as the sunsets over the Maracana. Flamengo have won and Matt is happy. As we set off to find a taxi to take us to our non-brothel hotel Matt is happy man- better than a day at the museum we agree. I wonder if our first driver of the day would still agree.</p>",
