            "content_html": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The closest I had ever been to a major international tournament until now was getting drunk in Dortmund for a week as a student during the 2006 World Cup. Balking at the </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">€</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">80 ticket price the touts were quoting for the glamour tie of Togo x Switzerland, I never quite made it inside the stadium. Being Scottish doesn't exactly lend itself to following the big tournaments up close, and prior to my lost week in Germany the only other finals I had been to was the Under-16s World Cup, when I watched through the tears as Paul Dickov and co. were defeated in the final by some suspiciously bearded Saudi Arabians. Thus, when the Copa America was announced as coming to Brazil, I was excited to finally watch some top quality international football and see some of the best South American players showcase their talent in their own back gardens.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is where problem one arose. No sooner had I managed to book my seven tickets (four group games and one for each knockout round) than my day job decided to send me to Boston for the first week of the competition. Faced with the dilemma of putting food on the table or seeing Messi in the flesh for the first time, I narrowly decided on the former and made my way disconsolately to the States, settling for watching Argentina lose 2 x 0 in the airport lounge. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Four group games down the drain, I finally got some luck when results worked in my favour and the pick of the quarters, Colombia x Chile, ended up at Sao Paulo’s Arena Corinthians stadium, colloquially known as </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Itaquerao</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Maybe this tournament might work out for me after all, I thought. Considering Argentina have managed to limp into a semi-final against Brazil, which I also have tickets for, it seemed that things could be worse.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Arena Corinthians is beautiful stadium built for the 2014 World Cup, but it does lack in any stadium-side entertainment. Not to be put off, we managed to imbibe near gallon-sized beers from the shopping centre food court and were in good spirits as we made our way to the stadium. That mood was somewhat dampened as one of our number had his phone pinched from his pocket as we crushed our way through the security checkpoint. His first ever game of football; he might not be back!</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Settling into our fancy seats, the atmosphere was fantastic. Finally, the grandeur of the occasion had managed to outweigh the overpriced tickets, and a near capacity stadium belted out the national anthems of Chile and Colombia. I was in a stadium, at a major tournament, and it was living up to the hype. Before me were Rodriguez, Vidal and, a rare sight for any United fan, a starting Sanchez. The game took off at a good pace and I thought we might be in for the classic that the tournament needs to breathe some life into what until now has been a bit of a damp squib. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I thought…</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">See, there has been an unwanted guest that has reared its ugly head more than a few times at the tournament already. A boorish cretin of a party-pooper intent on spoiling all the fun. VAR had been invited, gorged itself on the group stage hors-d'oeuvres and was now vomiting disallowed goals all over the place. Game after game of this tournament has been made duller for the introduction of this new technology and, much like at the Women’s World Cup, its use, and whether the officials in charge possess the ability to use it effectively or not, has caused much debate. And here, sixteen minutes into my first international tournament game, it was out to spoil my fun.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As footballing soothsayer and general polyglot Barry Glendenning has pointed out on the Guardian Football Weekly Podcast, if you don’t like something there is one way to make the governing organisations understand - “don’t go”. With his Irish lilt ringing in my ears, I decided to willfully misunderstand his advice and stage my own minor protest. I had had enough and I wouldn’t let VAR spoil the rest of my night. Out of my R$400 seat I got and out of the stadium I went - much to the confusion of the turnstile operator who seemed to think I wanted to leave and return, and finally acquiesced to my leaving when I convinced him I had no intention of ever returning.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So off I sulked. Turns out there was another Chile goal chalked off in the second half. Technically right, but unnecessary and to the detriment of the game. I was already home by then, watching some comedy and glad that I could put the misery of my sixteen minute international debut behind me. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, I appreciate that I might be archaic here, and it has crossed my mind that valuing entertainment over fairness could be my own personal anachronism. I didn't complain much at the introduction of VAR in last year’s World Cup, however my personal experience was certainly tainted as the wind was taken out of Palmeiras’ comeback against Boca in last season’s Copa Libertadores after another dubious and dispiriting decision. Maybe it is just me, but I doubt it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, do I regret it? To be honest, maybe one fewer gallon of beer and my decision might have been different. However, I’m happy that I chose to make a small, unnoticed stand. Imagine if everyone was willing to forgo their place in the stadium and vote with their feet: I imagine we might be able to get FIFA to have a second thought if come the semi-final on Tuesday, and come the inevitable VAR nonsense, everyone got up and walked out. I’m guessing that even I might shrink from the idea of leaving Messi, Aguero, Coutino and Firmino out there in an empty stadium, but what a sight it would be and what heads would be turned. Knowing FIFA and their disdain for the fan, probably not as many as you would hope, but it’s worth a try, isn't it?</span></p>",

            "content_html": "<br><br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Early on Saturday afternoon, small groups of Cololmbian and Argentinian fans milled around the cobbled streets of the city’s picturesque Pelourinho district, taking pictures of the historic buildings, enjoying some samba, and having their arms and legs covered in traditional, white symbols by streetside painters. The hot air hummed with an apprehensive, nervous excitement; both sets of supporters keenly aware of how the outcome of their blockbuster clash could set the tone for their tournament.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Arena Fonte Nova, one of the stadiums built by Brazil for the 2014 World Cup, is a modern update on a South American classic: a circular concrete bowl with huge grey pillars interspersed with sufficient spaces to give it an airy feel such as that of auditorium or coliseum. On Saturday, the home of Bahia Esporte Clube was host to a significant number of travelling Argentine fans and a much greater number of Colombians. By the end of the night, small groups of locals joined in with the celebrations and songs teasing their great rivals. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Throughout the evening fans mixed happily with each other to create a festival-like atmosphere of bonhomie, it was boisterous yet entirely pleasant and one couldn’t help but feel it would have been a useful education for the few hundred England supporters who make such a name for themselves through their own, entirely contrary behaviour. As always, local supporters performed their role as hosts with arms open, unafraid to participate in the occasion.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The game itself promised much, yet for the first half failed somewhat to live up to it’s expectations. Messi, who wasn’t seen here when the world cup visited five years ago, was the main attraction for many of the ‘neutrals’. An early roar of approval rippled round the stadium in the opening minutes when he produced a delightful touch and turn to evade three Colombians in tight space on his own touchline. That, however, was as good as it got for Argentina in the opening 45 minutes, their world-class front line looking increasingly isolated as the midfield misplaced passes, leaving only a couple of long-range efforts from Paredes to ask something of David Ospina in the Colombian goal. Were it not for the announcement of his name before kick-off, one wouldn’t have noticed De Maria, so insignificant was his contribution to the game.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Messi’s opposite number, James Rodriguez, had a far more comfortable evening, his impressive passes frequently spread possession to the flanks where Colombia’s pace often found Saravia and Tagliafico wanting. This was how the lead came, a beautiful lofted diagonal ball to the left finding Roger Martinez, who smartly drove inside, curling the ball across Armani and into the net on 71 minutes. It was down the left-flank once again where Colombia pressed home their advantage, Duvan Zapata finding Martinez, who fed the overlapping full-back Lerma, his low-ball into the box being finished perfectly by a straining Zapata. Argentina pressed in the late stages without ever really convincing.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the Colombians clinical attacking threat, orchestrated by Rodriguez, this was a game undoubtedly won from the back. Sanchez and Mina consistently repelled the Argentine thrusts forwards and kept Sergio Aguero in their pockets whilst in front of them Wilmar Barrios, the game’s outstanding performer, marshalled the midfield and kept Messi and co from gaining any real foothold with which to manoeuvre forward. A word too for Colombian boss Carlos Queiroz, whose excellent use of his squad had a decisive impact: both the goalscorers and the rapid Lerma were substitutes. With Paraguay and Qatar to come in the group, Colombia will have expectations of topping the group and a decent run until at least the semi-finals of this competition. On the other hand, Scaloni’s side continue to struggle to find their feet and will look ahead to the following two games with an element of trepidation.</span></p>",

            "content_html": "<p>Brazil got their home Copa America off to a winning start at Morumbi Stadium, Sao Paulo, thanks to goals from Coutinho (2) and Everton. Quick-fire second half goal from the Barcelona struggler Coutinho, the second from the spot, and a late finish from Gremio star Everton put some gloss on what was a largely disappointing performance- with the home team booed off the pitch at half time and met with silence for large swathes of the game.</p>\n<p>The opprobrium could have been worse but for the 20,000 empty seats littering the stadium. As we’ve mentioned before, Brazil, like so many countries these days, has gone for fewer people in more expensive seats as their business model; a model that can only further serve to alienate fans in a country were the minimum wage barely- if at all- covers the cost of living.</p>\n<p>Those that could afford the R$180 minimum ticket price voiced their displeasure as a guileless and unimaginative home side crossed endlessly to no one in particular. In scenes reminiscent of last year’s World Cup group stages, it was Coutinho to the rescue. However, without their trouble talisman Neymar, it seems this team will have to find someone else to share the creative burden as they undoubtedly creak through to the next round from a weak group. Will there be someone able to carry the expectations of the home crowd or could Brazil be facing the idea of not winning it on home soil for the first time in their Copa history?</p>",

            "content_html": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Round 4’s action kicked off with </span><strong>Botafogo</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> visiting city rivals </span><strong>Fluminense</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, as the team in black and white looked to follow up back to back wins with another 3 point haul after a disappointing opening day defeat to Sao Paulo. All of the early running was made by Fluminense, with </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">O Tricolor </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">missing a hatful of chances to take the lead. Botafogo were not so wasteful - </span><strong>Alex Santana</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> climbing high to head home Jonathan’s cross from the left in the 72nd minute. Fluminense pushed on in search of an equaliser and Matheus Ferraz had the ball in the back of the net for the home side, only to see his effort chalked off for offside after a VAR review. Botafogo were able to hang on for the </span><strong>0x1 </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">win and climb, albeit temporarily, to second place in the standings.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There were two other games on Saturday, the first of which saw </span><strong>Corinthians</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> host </span><strong>Gremio</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with both teams looking to kick start their seasons. As it transpired, this wasn’t the game for that as both teams defended stoutly and offered little invention going forward. The game had its moments however, with Gremio’s Luan desperately unlucky to strike the post with a lovely curling free-kick, and another VAR related kerfuffle as the video review rightly overturned the award of a penalty when the ball struck Corinthians full back Fagner’s arm from close range after Everton’s attempted cross. Neither side was able to find a breakthrough and their indifferent starts to the season continued with this </span><strong>0x0</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> draw. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The 9pm kick-off was a much more lively affair with both </span><strong>Goais</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><strong>Ceara</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> having opportunities to win the tie. </span><strong>Marlone</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> opened the scoring for Goias in the 21st minute - drilling home Kayke’s smartly back-heeled pass - but only after an absurdly long video review. Ceara then levelled matters in the 77th minute when </span><strong>Thiago Gallardo</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> got his head on the end of a freekick from just over halfway inside the Goias half. It looked like the match would end in a draw between these two evenly match sides, but Uruguayan forward </span><strong>Leandro Barcia</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> was able to win all three points for Goias in the first minute of injury time when he turned the ball home after his initial header had rebounded off the post to make it </span><strong>2x1</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sunday’s fixture list started with </span><strong>Flamengo’s</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> match against </span><strong>Chapecoense</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at the Maracana. After their midweek Libertadores exploits in Uruguay, Flamengo rested a number of first team players but still had too much for the team from Santa Catarina. </span><strong>Vitinho</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> opened the scoring after just eight minutes, sliding the ball past an onrushing Tiepo following a great through-ball from Miguel Trauco. Diego then wasted the chance to double Flamengo’s lead on the stroke of half-time as he struck a penalty straight at the Chapecoense keeper and wasn’t able to score the rebound despite an acrobatic effort. It mattered little though as </span><strong>Lincoln</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> turned home Ronaldo’s cross from close-range shortly after the break. Flamengo continued to have the better chances, but it was Chapecoense who scored the only other goal of the game with </span><strong>Gum</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> heading in a consolation goal in the 92nd minute to lose out </span><strong>2x1</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In Porto Alegre, </span><strong>Internacional</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><strong>Cruzeiro</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> were evenly matched for 45 minutes, both sides scoring after the 30 minute mark to go into the interval 1x1. Whatever </span><strong>Odair Hellmann</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, the Internacional coach, said to his players at half-time clearly worked however, and the second half was a much more one-sided affair. Goals from </span><strong>Paolo Guerrero</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><strong>Rodrigo Moledo</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> gave </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">O Colorado</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> an unassailable </span><strong>3x1</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> lead, even as Anders D’Alessandro missed a penalty for the home side. A bad day was made worse for the visitors as </span><strong>Edilson</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> was shown a straight red card in the fourth minute of added time. </span></p>\n<p><strong>Santos</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> cruised to victory over </span><strong>Vasco da Gama</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the Pacaembu on Sunday afternoon, with </span><strong>Rodrygo</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in a starring role as he chipped in with a goal and two assists. </span><strong>Jorge Sampaoli’s </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">team had enough chances to double their eventual score, but had to settle for a </span><strong>3x0</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> win and extending their unbeaten start. Santos’ other goals came from </span><strong>Diego Pituca’s</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> lovely finish after an error at the back from Vasco, and </span><strong>Yeferson Soteldo’s</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> close range strike after great work from man-of-the-match Rodrygo. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reigning champions </span><strong>Palmeiras</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> continued their strong start to the season by sweeping aside </span><strong>Atletico-MG </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">in Belo Horizonte. Two wonderful long-range strikes from </span><strong>Bruno Henrique</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> either side of half-time were enough to secure the </span><strong>0x2</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> win for </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">O Verdao </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and end Atletico’s winning start to the campaign.    </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The evening kick offs saw </span><strong>Sao Paulo</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> visiting the north-east to face club legend </span><strong>Rogerio Ceni’s</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> newly promoted </span><strong>Fortaleza</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. It has been a tough start to life in the top tier for </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">O Leao</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> having started their campaign against Palmeiras, visiting the home of in-form Botafogo last time out and now coming up against a Sao Paulo team who will hope to mount a more sustained challenge for the title this time around. After a predictably warm reception for the Fortaleza boss from both sets of fans, the match itself was a relatively even affair with the home side having the better of the few clear chances. The breakthrough came in the 77th minute when half-time substitute </span><strong>Hernanes</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> latched on to Hudson’s through ball and calmly slotted past Felipe Alves to give Sao Paulo the </span><strong>0x1</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> win and move his side up to 3rd place.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Elsewhere, </span><strong>Atletico-PR</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> played host to </span><strong>Bahia</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with the visitors looking to extend a good start and secure a third win of the season. It was Atletico-PR who started the more brightly, however, and their endeavour was rewarded when </span><strong>Rony</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> smashed the ball home from close range after Marco Ruben’s header was pushed away by Bahia keeper Douglas Friedrich. The forward thought he had doubled his tally and his side’s lead when he finished high into the net, only to see his effort disallowed for offside. The chances kept coming for the home team but they were unable to find a second goal to put the match to bed. They will feel satisfied, however, that they did enough to earn their </span><strong>1x0</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> win. </span></p>\n<br><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The last tie of the round saw two newly promoted teams face each other as </span><strong>Avai</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><strong>CSA</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> both looked to secure their first win of the season. There was a lack of quality on show from both sides, with chances at a premium, and the feeling is that if they are to survive the season there will need to be a dramatic improvement in the performances of both teams. A poor match ended in stalemate </span><strong>0x0</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, a point a little else for each side to take away.</span>",

With four teams left to play, inconsistency has marked the first week of Serie A competition as only two teams, </span><strong>Sao Paulo</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><strong>Atletico-MG</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, emerge with 100% records.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Palmerias</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> were held to a draw by newly promoted <strong>CAS</strong>. Having taken an early lead the <em>Porcos</em> were pegged back in the second half through CAS’ only shot on target. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Corinthians</strong> got their first win under their belt courtesy of a slender victory against <strong>Chapecoense</strong>. Augusto got the only goal of the game early in the second half of a tightly contested tie.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a battle of last season’s second x third International got the better of </span><strong>Flamengo</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and it was ex-Flamengista, Peruvian forward </span><strong>Paulo Guerrero</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, who gave them the early lead with a well-taken header to remind the <em>Rubro-Negro</em> exactly what they let go last season. <strong>Arrascaeta</strong> made it 1-1 with half an hour to go but </span><strong>Sarrafiore</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> grabbed the winner in the 77th minute, leaving them level with </span><strong>Flamengo</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and seven other teams on three points.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Germio</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><strong>Avai</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> played out a barely-watchable 1x1 draw, devoid of any creativity or ambition with both teams seemingly happy to earn their first point of the season. </span></p>\n<p><strong>Cruziero</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> bounced back from their defeat at </span>Flamengo<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on Saturday with a 1x0 win at home to <strong>Ceara</strong> in what was a surprisingly competitive game. The visitors set up defensively but produced a number of chances on the counter and were only denied by multiple saves from </span><strong>Fabio</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the Cruzeiro goal, including from a VAR-awarded penalty on 17 minutes. As the game wore on the home side’s quality began to tell and eventually they picked up the victory via a piece of quick-thinking from attacking-midfielder </span><strong>Thiago Neves.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Atletico Mineiro</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> inflicted  the second defeat of the season on </span><strong>Vasco</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and launched themselves up to the giddy heights of second. One of only two teams with a hundred percent record at this early point in the season, the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Galo’s </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">sealed a 2x1 victory through their Colombian internationalist </span><strong>Yimmi Chara’s</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> last minute goal. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The other table topping 100%-ers are </span><strong>Sao Paulo</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. They will be hoping that their early form continues to banish memories of last years midseason capitulation. Having lead from the start of last season the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tricolor </span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fell apart in the second half of the season finishing 5th and sacking their manager. New boss </span><strong>Cuca</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> saw his side win 2x1 courtesy of </span><strong>Pato’s</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> first goal of the season. <strong>Toro</strong> doubled their lead before <strong>Barcia</strong> pulled one back on the stroke of half time. Although the scoring stopped there the action continued until the 90th minute when </span><strong>Igor Vincius</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> saw red for a rather unorthodox two footed last man challenge. After a prolonged VAR consultation the red was rightly upheld.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Fortaleza</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> got an impressive win against high-flying </span><strong>Paranaense</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span><strong>Edinho</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> scored the quickest goal of the round, for Fortaleza, in the second minute- without the opposition having touched the ball. If anything, scoring such an early goal seemed to upset their own rhythm and they struggled to dominate thereafter; </span><strong>Leo Perreira</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> bagged the equaliser for CAP after 21 minutes. As the game drifted towards the close, </span><strong>Rogerio Ceni</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> altered his forward line with the introduction of </span><strong>Osvaldo</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><strong>Wellington Paulista</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and it proved decisive as the latter scored shortly afterwards. The away side pressed for an equaliser in the closing minutes but the defence held firm, roared on by the home supporters, who must now view the season ahead with optimism.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Thursday's Games</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Santos </strong>beat<strong> Fluminense </strong>2x1 with all the goals coming in the second half. <strong>Sasha</strong> bagged his second of the season and shortly after this lead was doubled by <strong>Sanchez</strong>. <strong>Pedro</strong> pulled a goal back in the 85th minute but Santos held on to contniue their winning start to the season.</p>\n<p><strong>Botafogo </strong>ran out 3x2 winners over<strong> Bahia </strong>in the last game of the round. Having taken an early lead the men from the North conceeded 3 in the last fifteen minutes of the first half to go into the dressing rooom facing an uphill task. They set up a tense finale with a goal in the 83rd minute but couldn't force an equaliser and left Rio empty handed.</p>",

Given that five of the home team’s last six games in their stadium had ended goalless draws, we can’t imagine there were too many neutrals tuning in. Those that did however, would have been relieved to see the net bulge more than once. While it was Pato’s return to Brazil that hogged all the pre-match headlines, it was goals from </span><strong>Everton</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at the end of the first half and </span><strong>Hudson</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in the 83rd minute that saw the Paulista runners up start the league with three points.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Internacional</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, who have been riding high in the Libertadores, were given a reality check with a 2x0 defeat at last season’s strugglers </span><strong>Chapecoense</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. They will have to  replicate their continental form quickly if they with to be in with a shout of repeating last year’s third place finish. The home team meanwhile, having adeptly avoided the drop since the tragedy of 2016, were tipped by many to go down this season, and new boss <strong>Ney Franco</strong> will be hoping this isn’t simply a case of new-manager syndrome.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Newcomers </span><strong>Avai</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> put up a good fight away to </span><strong>Atletico Mineiro MG</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> before losing out 2x1. They cancelled out </span><strong>Fabio Santos</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">’  45th minute goal immediately after the break through </span><strong>Brizuela</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> but their parity only lasted 8 minute before going down to a 53rd minute goal from <strong>Oliveira; </strong>they will now be aware of what lies ahead in their fight to stay up this season.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The day’s standout fixture between </span><strong>Flamengo</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><strong>Cruzeiro</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at the Maracana didn’t disappoint. Among 10 yellow cards and one red there were four goals. Cruzeiro took the lead a few minutes before half-time, Pedro Rocha providing the finish after some good work from the evergreen Fred. A matter of seconds later Flamengo were level, Fabio coming off his line but failing to deal with the cross as Bruno Henrique got their first, thereafter ensued an almost-comical race to grab the finishing touch as the ball drifted slowly towards the goal line; Bruno Henrique himself got his foot to the ball just before Gabigol could nod it home. Halfway through the first half Flamengo took the lead and again it was </span><strong>Bruno Henrique </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">who finished the move after Gabigol and Aaron linked up nicely in the right-hand side of the penalty area, though Cruzeiro could count themselves somewhat unlucky given the wicked deflection. Bruno Henrique continued a dominant individual performance by drawing a second yellow from Murilo Cerqueira, before stretching the defence one more time, his shot forcing Fabio to parry straight into the path of </span><strong>Gabigol</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to put the icing on the cake in this early-season battle between potential title contenders.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Sunday</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The day began with an impressive away win for </span><strong>Santos</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at </span><strong>Gremio</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The Peixe took a 2x0 lead by the 35th minute through goals from </span><strong>Sasha,</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> with</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">a lovely dink over the keeper</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and </span><strong>Jonatan</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> after Gremio failed to properly clear a corner. The hosts were unsurprisingly upset when they had a goal disallowed by VAR via an extremely marginal offside decision. They were however able to claim a late and rather thrilling consolation goal; Manchester City target Everton Soares demonstrating a frightening turn of pace and electric finish from a tight angle. That was in stoppage-time and there was still late drama to come, though sadly not of the fotballing variety; the game ending in the all-too-familiar sight of a crowd of players arguing with the officials before Derlis Gonzalez managed to get himself sent off after the final whistle had gone - perhaps not his greatest achievement. </span></p>\n<p><strong>Atletico Paranaense</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> will find themselves amongst the teams at the top after the first weekend. Having smashed 2 past </span><strong>Vasco</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in each half; only a 90th minute effort from the Rio team  stopped Atletico being goal-difference leaders at the end of the weekend. One of the teams keeping them off first place are </span><strong>Ceara</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. They ran out 4x0 victors against </span><strong>CSA</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. It looks like it will be a long season for the newly-promoted team from Alagoas.</span></p>\n<p><strong>EC Bahia</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> laid down their intentions by beating </span><strong>Corinthians</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> by the odd goal in 5 in Salvador. WIth scores tied a 1x1 at half time, Bahia rushed to a 3x1 second half lead before </span><strong>Clayson’s </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">90th minute goal made for a nervous finale.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The day’s late games saw mixed fortunes for the last two promoted sides to play this weekend. </span><strong>Goias</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> shocked </span><strong>Fluminense</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> at the Maracana with </span><strong>Rafael Vaz</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> netting a last minute winner for the away side. In São Paulo </span><strong>Palmeiras</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> steamrolled <strong>Rogerio Ceni</strong>’s </span><strong>Fortaleza</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> in his first managerial return to the city in which he made his legend as a player but left ignominiously when sacked from his beloved São Paulo FC in 2017.</span></p>",

            "content_html": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The new season is upon us as the state championships make way for the Brasileirao. Futebol Brazil has awoken from its summer slumber ready to fill you in on the season that lies ahead.</span></p>\n<p> <strong>Big Moves</strong></p>\n<p> <strong>Gabigol</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most notable in-league transfer was that of Gabigol. Last season’s top scorer netted eighteen times in Serie A for Santos, who despite a solidly mid-table finish looked to be flirting with relegation at one stage. Consequently, expectations will be understandably high in some quarters and it will be interesting to see if the 22-year-old has developed the maturity necessary for a consistent follow-up season. The early signs are good, with the ex-Inter Milan star bagging two goals in three games in the Copa Libertadores and seven from twelve in the Carioca championship. Flamengo will be hoping his goals can push them one step further to the title in 2019.</span></p>\n<p> <strong>Pato</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another return to Brazil for the once prodigal son Alexandre Pato marked the biggest coup from outside the league. Since leaving Brazil in 2015 Pato endured an unproductive stint on loan at Chelsea before a marginally better run at Villareal (though he at least got some game time with the latter). More recently however, he filled his boots in China with thirty goals in just forty-seven games. Now in his third stint playing in his homeland, the former Selecao star will be looking to continue his impressive scoring form when he returns to Paulista championship runners up Sao Paulo.</span></p>\n<p> <strong>Dudu</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Defending champions Palmeiras can count the signing of a contract extension of last years Golden Ball winner Dudu as their best piece of non-transfer transfer business, the attacking midfielder having put pen to paper on a new four-year deal last month. The diminutive Brazilian dominated many a defence in 2018 and with his pace and incision is a sure bet to continue terrorising full-backs up and down the country in 2019. </span></p>\n<p><br><strong>Ones to Look Out For</strong></p>\n<p> <strong>Everton Soares</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">High expectations and links to top Premier League clubs accompanied Everton’s graduation from Fortaleza’s youth set-up in 2012. Last season saw the Gremio forward reach double-figures for the first time in the Brasileirao and he was rewarded with a place in Tite’s squad for Brazil’s friendlies back in August. Having turned twenty-three last month and with seven goals in all competitions so far this season, 2019 could finally be his breakout year - Manchester City are understood to have already spoken to Gremio about a transfer to England in the next few months.</span></p>\n<p> <strong>Rodrygo</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Last season saw more big names make the annual migration to Europe. With Vinicius now establishing himself with Real Madrid, his soon to be teammate Rodrygo will have until June of this season to say his goodbyes to Brazil. It will be interesting to see how much game time and what sort of treatment last seasons “most promising newcomer” will receive.</span></p>\n<p> <strong>Antony</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having already proved a game winner for Sao Paulo’s sub-20 team, Antony will be looking to make the step up this season. He excelled as his team won the Copa do Brasil at youth level and will be hoping Pato’s arrival doesn’t limit his game time.</span></p>\n<p> <strong>Title Tilt</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">History dictates that we are likely to get our winners from the greater Sao Paulo or Rio area. Last season’s league went down to the penultimate game and this seasons should be just as exciting: runners-up </span><strong>Flamengo</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> having added 2018’s top-scorer in an effort to topple </span><strong>Palmeiras</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Only a brave individual would bet against the Verdao however, who having kept hold of key performers such as Dudu, Deyverson and Lucas Lima, will be confident of defending the title. As we saw in 2018, the team led by Felipao and an ageing-Felipe Melo seem to possess the required ‘know-how’ *ahem* to get the better of their rivals in tight situations.</span></p>\n<p> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite the pedigree of those above, 2019’s buzz team is undoubtedly </span><strong>Cruzeiro</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. The Minas giants strolled to the Mineiro title earlier this month and have utterly-dominated their (admittedly weak) Libertadores group - at the time of writing they’ve won five from five without conceding a single goal in over 450 minutes of continental football. Last year’s Copa do Brasil trophy is evidence of undoubted quality - the question now is can they maintain such a high-level of performance over thirty-eight games.</span></p>\n<p> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for the rest, early-season Libertadores form might not tell us much about how things will finish in December, but it’s certainly a more reliable indicator than the less-than-competitive state championships. Last season’s title dark horses </span><strong>Internacional</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are running away with their group, which contains no less than the holders, River Plate. Similarly, </span><strong>Atletico Paranaense</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are topping a group with last year’s other illustrious finalists Boca Jrs. Fresh from winning the Copa Sudamericana, the Curitiba side aren’t a bad outside bet for a title push that would really upset the established axes of power in Brazilian football.</span></p>\n<p> <strong>New Boys</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Up from Serie B come CSA, Goias, Avai and Serie B champion Fortaleza. It will be a baptism of fire for Fortaleza as they meet Palmeiras at the Allianz this Sunday. CSA will host the Porcos in the following game week so we should have an early indicator how these two will fare with the step up.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Love or hate the state competitions, the Brasileirao is where the modern day meat of competition lies for the colossuses of Brazilian football. With plenty of twists and turns along the way - along with a certain Copa America in July- this promises to be a great year ahead. </span></p>\n<p><br><br></p>",

            "content_html": "<p>Last month the draw for the 2019 Copa America was made to much fanfare. A slew of former pros graced the stage, providing us with the media-savvy answers you might expect - other than the Paraguay representative, who creased up at the concept of Qatar and their rich footballing history joining the party!</p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It isn’t so long since the World Cup was here, and even less time since Brazil won their first men’s Olympic gold for football on home soil. So you might well assume that, with these tournaments not more than five years in the past, we are looking forward to a faultless tournament played in some cutting-edge stadiums. You might well assume that the infrastructure is in place for a smooth festival of football. Well, you know what they say about assumption...</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Around the world, the 2014 World Cup is largely regarded as a success. However, closer to home in Brazil it is seen through a different lens (and not just because of the game in Belo Horizonte that shall not be named). The months before the tournament were mired in protest and widespread dismay at the cost of the thing in a country where the average wage is around $20 USD a day. A less than popular move to help finance the massive building work required for such an event was to hike up bus fares, thus hurting those who benefited least from hosting. As a result,  normal working people ended up financing stadia they would never see and a variety of projects that they would barely be able to afford to use. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, while football fans from all over the world congregated in Rio and beyond to watch the elite of international football battle it out, the residents were left to go about their day considerably worse off.  Fair play to England who, obviously aghast at this social injustice, decided to head home at the earliest possible point, their protest at the World’s inequalities a noble gesture. England’s philanthropy aside, while the rest of the World partied ‘samba style’, ordinary Brazilians were paying the price.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">‘But’, perhaps you are ready to say; ‘these things bring lots of money to a country and its people.’ Maybe you are ready to add,  ‘and they end up with some great stadiums in a football-mad country.’ Then you might want to conclude, ‘and at the very least they will have new train lines, buildings and services all aided by the increased tourist flow’. Alas, the assessment of those statements is: wrong; wrong-ish; and wrong.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every time a big sporting event comes to a country, we are always inundated with news reports citing the billions it will bring to the economy. While there certainly will be billions spent in that country, it might not always be spent in the right places. While I’m no economist, I can see that the building of infrastructure requires labour and thus jobs (unless we are going the Qatar route of modern slavery; way to think outside the box, Qatar!). I’m sure economists from Adam Smith through to the Brexit crew would agree that jobs are good. However, these jobs and services are primarily being paid for out of the Brazilian taxpayers’ pockets.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to financial analysts from the Saxo Group, of the $18 billion invested in the tournament, $14 billion came from the Brazilian people themselves, not the external tourist cash as we are often led to believe. As Forbes point out, the cost of putting on the tournament was 61% of the annual education budget but hey, who needs school? (Unless you want to count Neymar’s salary, or keep track of the goals his team let in during that semi - then it could be useful for Brazilian kids). </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You know things are bad, however, when FIFA decide to issue a document defending the World Cup. Rather than their usual, “Fuck you, we are in charge” attitude, they actually released a statement defending the 2014 World Cup. Broaching subjects such as the aforementioned misappropriation of funds that could have been used for education, through to their demands that Brazil build 12 new stadiums, the document reads like a schoolboy shouting “It wasn’t me!” as the teacher(if you can afford one) enters the room to a scene of destruction. When FIFA start lawyering up, the alarm bells should be ringing; there must be a MASSIVE problem.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Indeed, the problems of corruption in the country were deemed so colossal that it has managed to swing the country towards a far right President who has a yearning for the good old days of dictatorship.A president who, ironically enough, chose the Brazil home kit to front his “Brazil is my party” campaign. Obviously not all of that corruption was associated with the World Cup or football, but the Brazilian FA aren’t showing themselves to be the cleanest organisation with former head Jose Marin jailed last year for accepting bribes from TV companies for broadcasting rights to...Copa America!</span></p>\n<br><br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, now we can agree that it costs quite a lot of money to host an international football tournament and the financial benefits are, to quote the credit rating business Moody’s, “fleeting” at best, let's move on to the legacy. Events such as this are meant to increase the standard of living across a country. Transport, security and sporting facilities are all meant to improve as the country readies itself for the influx of people from around the world. Not so in Brazil 2014. Of the 12 host cities, only Rio finished all their construction projects; and I mean by now Now, in 2019, only Rio have finished!</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maybe not the transport then, but the stadiums. Well yes, the stadiums were all finished for kick off and resplendent throughout - bar Arena Corinthians, which had a temporary stand installed at one end. However, within a year of the event, the third most expensive stadium in the world, the $900 million Estadio Nacional in Brasilia, was being used as a car park. Corinthians finally finished their stadium, but still can’t get out from under the debt caused by having to rent their home from the state, and the Arena da Amazonia is living up to its name having been reclaimed by the world’s largest rainforest. </span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of all the stadia used, 10 were new, such as the 42,000 seater Arena da Baixada. New home of Atletico Paranese, it had about 13,000 fans the day I went to watch them. With a retractable roof and all the mod-cons of a premium stadium, it cast an eerie atmosphere, even when the home team were on a run of 5 victories in a row and winning 3-0 on the day. Even taking into account that four out of the six venues being used for the Copa America 2019 were built for the World Cup, that is still 33% of the tournament being played in stadiums that were already standing pre-2014.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Despite all this, six months away from the tournament, here at Futebol Brazil we’re giddily waiting for the tournament to begin.If things go their way, Brazil will have the chance of redemption in Belo Horizonte-in a semi-final no less. Messi will have one last crack at a Copa, having lost the last two finals, and Neymar should be fully rested from his annual get-injured-or-suspended-so-I-can-go-to-my-sister’s-birthday-party. Even good old Qatar have shown themselves a more serious on-field proposition, beating Japan 3-1 in the final of the Asian equivalent of the Copa last month. All in all,  the tournament will, no doubt, be seen as a success, but let’s not pretend it didn’t come at a big cost. </span></p>",

            "content_html": "<p>Every year, usually in the first few months when the state championships begin, the debate returns: should these championships be axed?</p>\n<p>​In a country as vast as Brasil, this issue is complex because of the major internal differences. The national championship, the Campeonato Brasileiro, is only disputed between the teams of the principal states, whilst the press, who exert such a great influence over the preferences of the average Brazilian fan, are all located in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. As a result, the concept of regionalised, state championships is one that faces increasing pressure with every passing year.</p>\n<p>​In view of these considerations, we return to the beginning of football in the country, which occurred through the state championships. After all, geographically, a Brazilian state is usually the equivalent size of a European country.</p>\n<p>The first official competition, the Campeonato Paulista (Sao Paulo state championship) began in 1902. Other states soon followed suit, with the Baiano (Bahia) and Carioca (Rio de Janeiro) championships beginning in 1905 and 1906 respectively. Some European countries, such as England and Scotland, had already begun their national leagues some years before, but many, such as the Italian (1898) and German (1903) competitions, are practically the same age as the first of the Brazilian state championships.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div>With the championships, rivalries were born; many of the major rivalries of modern Brazilian football have their roots in the early 20th Century state competitions -   Grêmio and Internacional in Rio Grande do Sul, Bahia and Vitória in the state of Bahia and Corinthians and Palmeiras in São Paulo, just as examples, are only great clubs and historical rivals because of the regional tournaments. Due to structural and logistical issues, a Brazilian Championship was unthinkable at the beginning of the twentieth century. Additionally, the beginning of Brazilian football was especially localised: proudly rooted in the communities that formed the first clubs and associations.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>There were attempts to form wider competitions, particularly between Rio and Sao Paulo, and there was also the the Taca Brasil, the legacy of which can be seen in the formula of today's important Copa do Brasil. Nevertheless, it was only in 1971 that a lengthy and all-encompassing tournament, including clubs from all regions of Brazil, came into existence.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>In addition, therefore, to being more similar to the European nationals, the state chamionships hold, through their formation and geography, an essential part of the history of Brazilian football. It was in the Carioca that Flamengo became great, it was in the Paulista that Santos paraded the legendary team with Pelé and company in the 60s, and in every other state local clubs established themselves as the favourites of their people. Finally, the smaller and middle-sized clubs, who are now suffocated in shorter tournaments with little visibility or recognition, featured great stars, such as Socrates at Botafogo de Ribeirão Preto or Roberto Carlos at União São João, in many cases in times where the Brazilian national team shone much more than they do today.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>The project of the authorities is clear: to marginalise the state championships in favour of a national competition that concentrates on the big cities (especially in the capitals of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro), the richest clubs in the country, and sets aside much of the national territory for a 'quality football.' Thus, it should come as no surprise that many boys from the interior who have no relationship with the clubs of the capitals, and watch the gradual failure and sad decline of the local teams, choose to cheer for European clubs that ultimately bring together the great Brazilian stars.</div>\n<div> </div>\nKilling the state championships, an idea that advances with great support from the media, and creates a real chasm between the teams through payments for TV rights, is to destroy more than a little of what has made football the beloved sport of Brazilians.",
