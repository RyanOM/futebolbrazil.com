Internacional kept up the pressure with on the table toppers with a 2-0 victory over America-MG. Sao Paulo’s first match in the post-Diego Aguirre era ended in a 1-1 draw with Gremio, a result which further maintained the status quo at the top of the league. Parana couldn’t repeat the heroics of last weekend, but will heart from only losing 0-1 to Libertadores hopefuls Atletico-MG. Bahia’s 2-1 win over Ceara is probably enough to see them safe as they moved on to 44 points, meanwhile Sport and Vitoria would both have felt no better about their respective situations following their 0-0 draw. Corinthians fans must be longing for the end of the season as they had to endure yet another defeat, their 14th of the season, losing 1-0 away at Cruzeiro. Botafogo made it three wins on the spin, beating Chapecoense 0-1, and Flamengo won by the same scoreline at home against Santos to keep themselves in the race for the title.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In Round 35, Palmeiras’ fortunate habit of timing their missteps to match those of their top of the table rivals continued on Sunday, as they could only manage a draw away at Serie B-bound Parana, a blow to their title ambitions that was softened considerably by the news which filtered into the stadium that second placed Internacional had lost away at mid-table also-rans Botafogo. It was Parana who took the lead in the 35th minute of a rain-swept encounter: Keslley poking a low cross past a sprawling Weverton. Parana are experiencing something of a post-relegation bounce, given their woeful form for most of this season, but they were not able to keep Palmeiras completely at bay here and early in the second half they gave away a penalty after Willian’s goal-bound shot was handled in the area. There were to be no more goals under the grey Londrina sky, but a point against this season’s likely league champions will have felt like a victory for the home team.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over in Rio de Janiero, Internacional did their best to ensure that Palmeiras could sleep easy, slumping to a 0-1 loss against Botafogo following Erik’s smart 42nd minute finish; the right-sided winger bringing the ball under control with his chest, wrong-footing Zeca in the process, before slamming the ball home. Things did not improve for the away side in the second half, and the bad became farcical in injury-time as first Wellington Silva then Rodrigo Moledo were dismissed. Silva received a straight red for retaliation following a heavy tackle from behind by Rodrigo Pimpao, while Moledo can feel himself fortunate to have got away with a second yellow card after he pushed the referee when his penalty appeals were turned down.      </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the top two faltered, Flamengo grasped the opportunity to move into second place with a tight 0-1 victory over Sport Recife. Despite having Lucas Paqueta sent off for a second bookable offence in the 61st minute, Flamengo kept the pressure up and were rewarded for their endeavour when Willian Arao beat his marker just inside the 6-yard box to head past Mailson. In the battle for the fourth automatic Libertadores spot, both Gremio and Sao Paulo took maximum points in their home ties against Chapecoense and Cruzeiro respectively. Cicero met a high ball into the box to put Gremio one up after 24 minutes, with Everton beating Jandrei to a defence-splitting pass and lifting the ball over the goalkeeper to make it 2-0 in the 75th minute. Sao Paulo’s caretaker-manager, Andre Jardine, has the first win of his attempt to stake a claim to the job full-time. Diego Souza got the decisive goal, finishing acrobatically after Nene’s corner was headed into the ground by Robert Arboleda.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sunday also saw America-MG clinch a crucial win at the other end of the table, beating Santos 2-1 with goals from Rafael Moura and Matheusinho either side of the 17th goal of the season for the league’s </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">melhor marcador</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Gabriel. The win moved America-MG up two places to 17th, and within touching distance of safety.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On Saturday evening, Corinthians overcame a determined Vasco da Gama side 1-0 after Mateus Vital headed powerfully past Fernando Miguel from Fagner’s high hanging cross. A late Neilton penalty wasn’t enough to save Vitoria from defeat against Atletico-PR, and things are looking bleak for the team from Bahia as they are now winless in six and have a significantly worse goal difference than the other teams in the relegation zone. It was a bad day all round for the home side. Atletico-PR’s opening goal was gifted to them as Ramon got himself into a mix and ended up putting the ball in his own net after Marcelo Cirino’s header was palmed onto the post by Vitoria keeper, Joao Gabriel. They were also reduced to ten-men in the 89th minute when Jeferson received his second yellow card of the match. In Belo Horizonte, Bahia left disappointed that they could not make numbers count as they lost 1-0 to an Atletico-MG side who had Fabio Santos sent off in the 53rd minute. Just two minutes earlier, Juan Cazares had given Atletico-MG the lead with what turned out to be the winning goal, setting himself up for a wonderful half-volley from the edge of the Bahia box following Yimmi Chara’s cutback.   </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monday evening saw two out-of-form teams in the shape of Fluminese and Ceara battling to keep themselves clear of the drop zone. A draw was always the most likely result, and so it proved to be with both teams failing to find a way through in a game of few chances. With three matches left to play, neither side will be taking anything for granted, but a point and a clean sheet was a satisfactory outcome for all involved. </span></p></div><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__last-updated u-small">This article was updated on November 20, 2018</div><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ffutebolbrazil.com%2Fbrasileirao-rounds-34-and-35%2F" class="js-share facebook" title="Share with Facebook" rel="nofollow"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="https://futebolbrazil.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Ffutebolbrazil.com%2Fbrasileirao-rounds-34-and-35%2F&amp;via=%40FutebolBrazil9&amp;text=Brasileirao%20-%20Rounds%2034%20%26%2035" class="js-share twitter" title="Share with Twitter" rel="nofollow"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="https://futebolbrazil.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> </a><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Ffutebolbrazil.com%2Fbrasileirao-rounds-34-and-35%2F" class="js-share gplus" title="Share with Google Plus" rel="nofollow"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="https://futebolbrazil.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#gplus"/></svg> </a><a href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ffutebolbrazil.com%2Fbrasileirao-rounds-34-and-35%2F&amp;media=undefined
