A well worked move down the left was finished in spectacular style by Elias as he teed himself up to volley the ball into the top corner past a helpless Weverton, giving Atletico-MG the lead just under half-way through the second half. It took a good save from the Palmeiras goalkeeper to stop Luan making it two just minutes later, as he found space in the area after a give-and-go with Fabio Santos and unleashed a stinging low shot. It was Palmeiras, however, who got a rub of the green as they were awarded a soft penalty after Adilson was adjudged to have pulled back Edu Dracena in the 77th minute. Bruno Henrique duly scored a perfectly placed penalty, sending Victor the wrong way and the ball into the bottom right-hand corner, ensuring that that his team took another step towards the title. This step was made all the more comfortable by the news that in the north-east of the country Internacional were unable to capitalise on an early lead against Ceara, ending up with a 1-1 draw of their own. Leandro Damiao’s sixth goal in six games, finishing after Everson had blocked his initial shot, gave Palmeiras’ closest rivals the lead, before Ricardinho levelled matters in the 42nd minute, converting a low cross from close range.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Estadio Manoel Barradas played host to the weekend’s third derby, following Saturday’s ties, as Vitoria and Bahia played their roles in an entertaining 2-2 draw. The hosts Vitoria were twice pegged back as they went in search of a vital win and a chance to move out of the relegation zone. Bahia are much more comfortably placed in mid-table, six points above trouble, and this will certainly feel like two-points lost for Paulo Carpegiani’s struggling team. In Porto Alegre, Gremio snatched a win thanks to Matheus Henrique’s 95th minute goal. Thiago Galhardo finished off a break-away move to put Vasco in front on 12 minutes, only for Jael to equalise eight minutes later, heading in unmarked at the far post. Seventy five goalless minutes then followed until Matheus Henrique’s decisive contribution: an ambitious long range shot, which should have been dealt with easily but instead was fumbled into the net by Vasco’s Uruguayan #1, Martin Silva. Sunday’s action was rounded off by Sport Recife’s visit to Rio to meet Fluminese. Sport have enjoyed a great run of form in recent weeks, winning four of their last five, and will have arrived at the Maracana hopeful of another good result as they faced a side who have lost their last two without scoring. A goalless first half was followed by a scoreless second, however, and both teams had to settle for a point, a result which kept Sport Recife out of the bottom four, at least until Chapecoense play on Monday evening. Fluminese came closest to breaking the deadlock, and had the ball in the net late on after Luciano’s close-range finish, only for the assistant referee to flag it up as offside.  </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saturday’s match-ups saw derby action in both Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro as Flamengo visited Botafogo and Corinthians hosted city rivals Sao Paulo. Given their poor run of form recently, Corinthians gave a good account of themselves, holding Diego Aguirre’s team to a 1-1 draw despite going down to ten men shortly before the interval. Chilean midfielder Angelo Araos was sent-off for a second bookable offence when he hit out after a coming together with Reinaldo. In fact it was Corinthians who took the lead, Ralf on target with a low drive from distance after 72 minutes, but Sao Paulo finally made their numbers count as Brenner equalised nine minutes later, directing Nene’s goalbound shot past Cassio. Up the coast in Rio, Botafogo earned an important three points in a bad tempered 2-1 victory. Ten yellow cards were shown as goals from Erik and Leonardo Valencia earned the points for the team in black and white. Vitinho nodded in a reply for Flamengo early in the second half, but Botafogo did enough to hang on for the win.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Saturday’s other matches were similarly marked by ill-discipline. Both sides ended the match with ten men as already-relegated Parana visited America-MG. Parana’s Rene was the first to see red before Messias was also sent marching in the 86th minute. The match is likely to be remembered for more positive reasons however, by half of those concerned at least, as a 0-1 win for Parana ended a winless streak stretching all the way back to July. Atletico-PR and Cruzeiro went one better than the Rio derby as eleven players were booked in their encounter. Marcelo Cirino and Raphael Veiga’s first half goals were enough to win the points for Atletico-PR, a win which lifted them into 6th and the Libertadores qualifying round spots.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monday night football was provided by Chapecoense’s visit to Santos, as the away team looked to leapfrog their relegation rivals into 16th place.  </span></p></div><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__last-updated u-small">This article was updated on November 12, 2018</div><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ffutebolbrazil.com%2Fbrasileirao-round-33%2F" class="js-share facebook" title="Share with Facebook" rel="nofollow"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="https://futebolbrazil.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Ffutebolbrazil.com%2Fbrasileirao-round-33%2F&amp;via=%40FutebolBrazil9&amp;text=Brasileirao%20-%20Round%2033" class="js-share twitter" title="Share with Twitter" rel="nofollow"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="https://futebolbrazil.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> </a><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Ffutebolbrazil.com%2Fbrasileirao-round-33%2F" class="js-share gplus" title="Share with Google Plus" rel="nofollow"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="https://futebolbrazil.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#gplus"/></svg> </a><a href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ffutebolbrazil.com%2Fbrasileirao-round-33%2F&amp;media=undefined
