As with all modern football championships, there is an imbalance between the haves and have-nots, so while the the league table will certainly tell you who won the league, who will be contesting next year’s Libertadores and who will be checking Wikipedia to find out where the hell Operario Ferroviario Esporte Clube ply their trade (Ponta Grossa in Parana, in case you’re wondering), it doesn’t show you which teams achieved more than was expected of a ragtag bunch of journeymen and green-horned hopefuls, and which teams once again caused their fans to question why their side has less stamina for the race than an arthritic Shetland pony. Here’s our take on the teams who finished in the top half of the table.</span></p><br><p><strong>1st - Palmeiras</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It took until Round 37 for </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">O Verdao </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">to confirm their record-extending tenth Brasileirao title, although from September on it looked unlikely that anyone would be able to stop Big Phil’s boys in green from claiming the crown. With a home record that reads P19 W16 D2 L1, including 13 straight wins between July and the end of the season and 22 games without suffering defeat, it’s not hard to see why last season’s runners up were worthy champions this time round. A wily old coach, a mean defence and the ability to get goals from all over the pitch (only striker Willian reached double figures) made this a very enjoyable season for <em>O</em></span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">s Porcos.</span></i></p><p><strong>Grade: A+</strong></p><p><strong>Player of the Season: Dudu</strong></p><br><p><strong>2nd - Flamengo</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Credit is due to Brazil’s most widely supported team for pushing Palmeiras all the way, but even the most dedicated fan of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">O Mengao </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">must have sensed that it was not going to be their year long before Deyverson’s goal away at Vasco confirmed it. It seemed that for every misstep that Palmeiras took, Flamengo were right there behind them managing to find a banana skin all of their own. Still, this was a much better season than 2017 and credit must got to a squad that comfortably finished second despite having three managers in the calendar year. They will be hoping to go one better next year and end what will then be a ten-year wait for another title.</span></p><p><strong>Grade: A-</strong></p><p><strong>Player of the Season: Cuellar</strong></p><br><p><strong>3rd - Internacional</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The season’s surprise package came in the form of last season’s Serie B runners up, although given Internacional’s pedigree it’s perhaps not a shock to see the side back where many fans believe they belong. Relegated for the first time in their history in 2016, they bounced straight back and, after a poor start in which they won only one of their opening five fixtures, continued bouncing up the table to become unlikely title contenders. In truth, it never looked like it was going to be the fairytale </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">O Nacao Vermelha </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">were dreaming of, and in the end they finished well behind the champions. Nevertheless, they will continue to enjoy their rehabilitation under coach Odair Hellmann as they enter next season’s Libertadores.</span></p><p><strong>Grade: A</strong></p><p><strong>Player of the Season: Victor Cuesta</strong></p><p><strong>4th - Gremio</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With their attention so focussed on the ultimately unsuccessful attempt to retain their Libertadores title, it’s not hard to imagine that had Gremio’s priorities lay in matters on the domestic front they might be basking in the glory of a first league title since 1996. A home record to rival Palmeiras was let down by flaky away form, but the team from Porto Alegre have enough about them to trouble any of the teams in the league.     </span></p><p><strong>Grade: B</strong></p><p><strong>Player of the Season: Everton</strong></p><br><p><strong>5th - Sao Paulo</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And so to the arthritic Shetland pony of the introduction to this piece. First 19 games - W12 D5 L2; last 19 games - W4 D10 L5. ‘A game of two halves’ would be a kind way of describing a season which imploded when the team and their now departed journeyman manager, Diego Aguirre, got a serious case of vertigo when leading the league at the halfway point. Aguirre - manager of 14 teams in 16 years - left the team at the beginning of November but incoming head coach Andre Jardim could only steady the ship. Positives to be taken after a 13th place finish in 2017 for sure, but more heartache for fans who wonder when the glory days will return.</span></p><p><strong>Grade: C-</strong></p><p><strong>Player of the Season: Diego Souza</strong></p><br><p><strong>6th - Atletico-MG</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Always an entertaining side to watch, Atletico-MG were involved in two of the most exciting games of the season - beating both Fluminese and Sport Recife 5-2 at the Estádio Raimundo Sampaio in Minas Gerais. A leaky defence featuring a 39-year old Leonardo Silva did them no favours, despite the heroics of goalkeeper Victor, and they will perhaps feel that an automatic Libertadores spot should have been theirs for the taking.</span></p><p><strong>Grade: B-</strong></p><p><strong>Player of the Season: Ricardo Oliveira</strong></p><br><p><strong>7th - Atletico-PR</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another side who were able to improve their 2016 standing, and another that did so in some style. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">O Furacao </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">lived up to their nickname by delivering four of the biggest home wins of the season (5x1 vs. Chapecoense; 4x0 vs. Vitoria, America-MG and Sport Recife). The second half of the season saw 11 wins and went a long way to addressing a poor start. They even found time to lift their first Copa Sudamericana. Fans who delighted in their team’s attacking prowess this season, will no doubt be looking forward to climbing new heights in 2019.</span></p><p><strong>Grade: A</strong></p><p><strong>Player of the Season: Pablo</strong></p><br><p><strong>8th - Cruzeiro</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Back-to-back titles in 2013 and 2014 mean that expectations always run high in pre-season that Cruzeiro may mount another tilt at the title. A mid-season slump and a serious lack of firepower - they scored fewer goals than relegated Vitoria and Sport Recife - meant that this attempt never got off the ground, and they have a tight defence to thank for a Sudamericana spot they barely did enough to deserve.</span></p><p><strong>Grade: C-</strong></p><p><strong>Player of the Season: Dede</strong></p><br><p><strong>9th - Botafogo</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since re-entering the top flight in 2016, Botafogo seem to have allayed fears that their 2014 relegation would lead to the historic side yo-yoing between leagues. Just three wins on the road all season however suggest that manager Ze Ricardo has a job on his hands to address one of the most porous defences outside of the relegated sides, and a team that lacks the self-belief to stand up to the ghosts of their illustrious past.    </span></p><p><strong>Grade: C</strong></p><p><strong>Player of the Season: Igor Rabello</strong></p><br><p><strong>10th - Santos</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Where would Santos be without returning hero Gabriel Barbosa? Fans of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">O Peixe </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">will be thankful that it’s a question that they don’t have to answer, because even with the league’s top scorer they never looked like breaking into the Libertadores positions, never mind the elite G4. The sacking of Paulistao winning coach Dorival Junior in 2017 looks like a significant error as they cast around for an appropriate replacement. They will be hoping that Cuca, their third manager in 18 months, is that man.</span></p><p><strong>Grade: C-</strong></p><p><strong>Player of the Season: Gabriel Barbosa</strong></p></div><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__last-updated u-small">This article was updated on December 17, 2018</div><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ffutebolbrazil.com%2Fseason-review-part-one%2F" class="js-share facebook" title="Share with Facebook" rel="nofollow"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="https://futebolbrazil.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Ffutebolbrazil.com%2Fseason-review-part-one%2F&amp;via=%40FutebolBrazil9&amp;text=Season%20Review%20-%20Part%20One" class="js-share twitter" title="Share with Twitter" rel="nofollow"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="https://futebolbrazil.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> </a><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Ffutebolbrazil.com%2Fseason-review-part-one%2F" class="js-share gplus" title="Share with Google Plus" rel="nofollow"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="https://futebolbrazil.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#gplus"/></svg> </a><a href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ffutebolbrazil.com%2Fseason-review-part-one%2F&amp;media=undefined
